<p>Last week we shared a photo of Sri Lestari, a social worker who is employed by a Whirlwind partner, <a href="http://www.ucpwfh.org/">UCP Wheels for Humanity</a>, in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.&nbsp; We found out after our post that she has been asked to speak at the<a href="http://tedxubud.com/"> TEDx Ubud</a> conference on June 1st.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sri is hoping to make her trip to Ubud a much richer experience by traveling from Jakarta to Ubud on her modified motorbike increase awareness and share her experiences with others in the disabled community along the way.</p>



<p>I asked Sri what motivated her to make this trip (almost 750 miles) on motorbike. She responded with the following:</p>



<p><em>“Since I work in UCP Wheels for Humanity 2009, I visit more disable who just stay at home.&nbsp; They are happy when they see me, because I am disabled, I am a women and I can work. I really want to share my experience how can be life independence and healthy as disabled (paraplegic).<br>“The campaign really important because disabled in Indonesia still difficult to get out from their houses because no access, especially for public transportation.&nbsp; My live change since I have modified motorcycle.</em></p>



<p>“Most people didn’t trust me when I told them that I am paraplegia, they surprise I can live independently, go everywhere by myself on the modified motorcycle and can work. When I do social assessment with the paraplegic, at the beginning they don’t believe me, after I talk deeply about paraplegic they are more open, when I told them that I can ride the modified motorcycle they smiling, I am so happy can make them smiling, after that they will contact me regularly and more deeply asking how can be independent specially for our daily live and get a job and they invite me to visit them with my motorcycle.</p>



<p>“Each time there are new paraplegic in my hometown some friends will tell me to visit them, mostly family who has disabled very happy when I visit them. Some of them&nbsp; are desperate&nbsp; to support the disabled&nbsp; to have more spirit, because the disabled&nbsp; will said that you are not feel what I am feeling, but when I talk to them they won’t refuse me, because I just like them.</p>



<p>“Some Mom who has children with disability said that, they want they children can be like me, even be diffable person but still can work.</p>



<p>“I am happy because I can work n earn money, so I can do home visit to my paraplegia friends in my home town or Yogyakarta in the weekend, share my experience n give them motivation.</p>



<p>“But I also want to share out of my home town and out of Yogyakarta, so that why I really more supported to do the trip.</p>
