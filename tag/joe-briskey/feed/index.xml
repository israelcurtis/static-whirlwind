To go along with Joe’s active lifestyle, his family chose Whirlwind’s RoughRider®.  While Joe’s other chairs got stuck going over even small cracks in the sidewalk, the RoughRider allows him to navigate grass and some gravel enabling him to enjoy some of his favorite outdoor places.  <span class="gd">Executive Director of Push to the Finish, </span>Andrew <span class="gd">McMahon says,</span> “Joe must&#8217;ve said ‘I love it. I love it,’ five times that day when asked about his chair.”</p>
<p>Joe broke-in his new chair at the race on June 22.  While Joe has been in several races before, this was the first race of the season for Joe and by far his smoothest ride yet.  He finished in 27 minutes with the assistance of Andrea Foxx.</p>
<p>Way to go Joe! We look forward to hearing about more of your outdoor adventures!</p>
