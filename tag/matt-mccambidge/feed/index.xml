Members of San Francisco State’s Student Section of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) are working with Whirlwind on building a hand-powered front-wheel-drive tricycle as a club project. The club has been responsible for welding, fabricating, and contributing to the iterative design process through testing. “The team of undergraduate students is learning valuable skills to help their eventual careers in engineering,” says club president Nic Celeste, “while seeing first-hand how engineering and design can help make the world a better place for those with limited mobility.” The ASME Trike Project is overseen by Whirlwind product designer Aaron Wieler. It is one of several engineering and entrepreneurship projects that we are currently working on with students at San Francisco State, where our headquarters and shop are located.</p>
