										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Many small manufacturers of wheelchairs throughout the world&#8217;s developing countries do not have the resources and technical background to test their products for safety and durability. This paper suggests some essential tests which they can easily perform. The tests are based on fifteen years of experience with the Whirlwind type wheelchairs (which are manufactured and used in developing countries), and on the ISO International Standard for Wheelchairs.</span></p>
<p><em>The paper is intended for use by manufacturers in developing countries who are working to improve wheelchair quality.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Background<br />
</strong></span><br />
There are many small to medium size wheelchair manufacturing shops throughout the developing world. In order to successfully market their chairs and serve their customers these manufacturers must provide chairs that are safe, durable, and good performers, and that are producible at affordable prices. This is an enormous challenge where money and materials are very limited. Although many wheelchair designer-mechanics demonstrate a high degree of skill and innovation in building chairs with available materials and tools, they often lack the background &#8212; either educationally or experientially &#8212; to evaluate their designs for safety and durability.</p>
<p>In recent years, a standard for evaluating &#8220;Western&#8221; wheelchairs has been established. It is the ISO International Standard for Wheelchairs, dated 1997 (1,2). (Previously, it was the similar ANSI/RESNA Wheelchair Standards.) These extensive Standards cover many subjects including: A uniform description of the basic seating dimensions of chairs so that consumers and health workers can accurately place orders; ways of determining tipping stability; minimal strength requirements to assure that the chair will not bend or break due to occasional high forces; and standard methods for testing long term durability where the chair is subjected to the equivalent of a lifetime of riding on rough surfaces and being dropped.</p>
<p>There are several facilities in the United States and Europe equipped to perform the tests (3). Ideally, manufacturers in developing countries should submit sample chairs for testing at one of these facilities. However, the cost of transportation and testing is often prohibitive</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Problem Statement<br />
</strong></span><br />
Manufacturers in developing countries need simplified standards for testing their chairs. The testing methods, and minimum specified values, need to be appropriate for their testing capabilities, and their customers&#8217; riding environments. They need to include at least the tests essential to preventing catastrophic or serious functional failures.</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Tests and Testing Method<br />
</strong></span><br />
Fortunately, the following essential strength tests can be performed by manufacturers using simple equipment and procedures. However, the durability tests, and some of the impact tests, specified in the ISO Standard require complex machines that small manufacturers cannot afford. The issue of durability will be covered later under Results and Discussion.</p>
<p>The tests, testing methods and minimum values have been developed by Ralf Hotchkiss (see Acknowledgements), and others, during the more than fifteen years history of Whirlwind-type wheelchairs. They are based on mechanical analysis, laboratory testing to ISO Standard, and extensive field testing by Ralf Hotchkiss and other riders. They found that a chair that passes these simple static or impact force tests is likely to pass the ISO tests. More importantly, it will also survive active use in rugged Third World riding conditions.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the static and impact strength test forces a wheelchair of any design should withstand without breaking or sustaining permanent structural deformation. Tests which are in addition to those in the ISO International Standard for Wheelchairs, Part 8, or that have more demanding test values, are marked with an &#8220;*&#8221;. The rest are similar, but not necessarily identical, to those in the ISO Standard. Some test load values are followed by an &#8220;e&#8221; to indicate they are estimates of dynamic values. The related Paragraphs in the ISO Standard are in brackets.</p>
<p><strong><em>A description of each test follows its minimum test value.</em></strong></p>
<p>All the tests can be performed using a tape measure, large square (e.g., a wood or metal sheet with a square corner), spring scale, and a lever-arm made of strong pipe for measuring moments. For impact velocities, the tester can practice propelling the chair at 1.5 meters per second by, say, learning to traverse 12 meters in 8 seconds &#8212; a fast walking speed.</p>
<p>The lettered arrows (vectors) on the diagram show the direction and point of application on the test forces. A 91 Kg (200 lbm) active adult rider (either a dummy or willing person with a weight in their lap) is assumed.</p>
<p>To check for permanent deformations, before-and-after test measurements should be made using the tape to measure the distance from:</p>
<p>&#8211; Rear wheel-to-rear wheel at the front and rear (toe-in or toe-out). Better, back the chair against a flat wall. Use a large square and tape to measure perpendicularity of each rear wheel to the wall.</p>
<p>&#8211; Rear wheel-to-rear wheel at the top and bottom (camber). Better, set the chair on a flat surface and use the square and tape to measure the perpendicularity of each rear wheel.</p>
<p>&#8211; Caster axle to a rear-most point on the bottom of the each side frame. Measure when the casters are in the rolling-straight ahead position.</p>
<p>&#8211; Foot rest mounting points on the side frames to rearward points on the frames.</p>
<p>&#8211; Side-to-side between side frames at the foot rest mounting points, caster pivot bearing barrels, rear of bottom frame, and push handles, and between the front and rear of the seat tubes.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test Values and Descriptions</strong><br />
The order in which the tests are generally listed is determined by the clockwise progression of the lettered force vectors around the diagram. Please note that this is not necessarily the order in which the tests should be performed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
<strong>Test A, Downward Force on Footrests</strong><br />
1,000 N (225 lbf)[P8.5] &#8212; Force of rider&#8217;s leg pushing, or a &#8220;hitchhiker&#8221; standing, on Footrest. Test by holding the chair so the Footrest is parallel to the ground. Stand on it. Test both footrests if there are two.</span></p>
<p><strong>Test A</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test B*, Footrest Rolling Impact</strong><br />
1,800e N (400e lbf)[P9.6] &#8212; Impact force on one footrest or front of chair running into a solid object. Test by hitting a solid step at 1.5 m/sec (4.8 ft/sec) &#8212; a typical rolling speed, at about 90 degrees and 45 degrees. Test both sides.<br />
<strong><br />
Test B</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test C*, Caster Wheel Rolling Impact</strong><br />
1,800e N (400e lbf)[P9.5] &#8212; Peak force when one Caster Wheel with a soft rubber or pneumatic tire impacts a solid step. Test as for B except a 7 cm (3 inch) thick block is against the curb. This tests both the caster fork and casterwheel. Impact each caster wheel at about </span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">90 degrees and 45 degrees</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> to the block.<br />
<strong><br />
</strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test C</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test D*, Caster Force Bending Strength</strong><br />
195e N-M (140e lbf-ft) &#8212; Moment on a Caster Fork due to C. Component test using a vise and lever-tube over the stem. About 40 mm (1.5 in) of the fork should extend above the vise.<br />
<strong><br />
Test D</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test E*, Wheelie Drop Off Inclined Curb</strong><br />
950e N (200e lbf) &#8212; Approximate sideways force on a rear wheel when doing a wheelie off a 18 cm (7 in) step, with the chair tipped sideways 5degrees, pneumatic tires on rear wheels, or rolling off a level step at an angle so that the rear wheels don&#8217;t hit simultaneously. Test by doing a wheelie off an inclined plane. It is also, the approximate force that a well-spoked 24 inch rear wheel should withstand without collapsing. </span></p>
<p><strong>Test E</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test F*, Rear Axle and Mount Bending Strength</strong><br />
280e N-M (200e lbf-ft) &#8212; Moment on Rear Axle due to E. Component test using a lever-tube over the axle while the side frame is held securely against a vertical reference surface.</span></p>
<p><strong>Test F</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test G*, Upward Force on Push Handles</strong><br />
1,140 N (250 lbf)[P8.10] &#8212; Lifting force on Push Handle when pulling chair up a 18 cm (7 in) stair with one hand. Test by doing so.</span></p>
<p><strong>Test G</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test H, Handgrip Attachment</strong><br />
1,000 N (225 lbf)[P8.7] &#8212; Rearward pulling force on Handgrip during G &#8211; difficult to test. Use a good rubber/plastic-to-metal-to-glue and skip testing.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test I*, Inward Force on Seat and Seatback Tubes</strong><br />
280e N-M (200e lbf-ft) &#8212; Moment on Folding Mechanism or Frame Cross Members when doing a wheelie off a 18 cm (7 in) step. It is best to test a complete loaded wheelchair by doing a wheelie off a step as in tests E and L. </span></p>
<p>For a frame assembly component test lay the chair on its side and squeeze the push handles together with the force necessary to cause the specified moment about the axle position.<br />
<strong><br />
Test I</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test J*, Seat Back Tube Bending Strength</strong><br />
610e N (135e lbf) &#8212; Pulling force of Seat Back fabric on top of Seat Back Tubes during test I. Do not test since this is redundant with Test I.<br />
<strong><br />
Test J</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test K*, Downward Force on Armrests</strong><br />
1,140 N (250 lbf)[P8.4] &#8212; Rider&#8217;s hand force on armrest during a pressure relief &#8220;push up&#8221;, or when boosting up to sit on the armrest to reach high. Test by applying load to armrest.</span></p>
<p><strong>Test K</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test L*, Wheelie Drop Off Level Curb</strong><br />

<p><strong>Test L</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test M*, Frame Twisting Strength</strong><br />
Twisting moment on frame cross members when only two diagonal wheels are supporting the wheelchair on rough ground. Test with rider seated, tester holds one footrest down while lifting the opposite side-frame with force of 355 N (80 lbf).</span></p>
<p><strong>Test M</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test N, Upward Force on Footrests</strong><br />
440 N (100 lbf) [P8.9] &#8212; Upward force on non-folding footrest. Folding or removable footrest must fold or remove at less than 44 N (10 lbf) applied at the free end.</span></p>
<p><strong>Test N</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test O, Upward Force on Armrests<br />
</strong>895 N (200 lbf) [P8.8] &#8212; Upward force on Armrest. If the armrest swings away or is removable, this must occur at less than 90N (20 lbf).</span></p>
<p><strong>Test O</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Test P, Handling Drop Test</strong><br />
1m (39in), empty &#8212; Impact during handling. Drop from the height on to each wheel when opened and folded.</span></p>
<p><strong>Test P</strong></p>
<p><strong>Results of employing the tests</strong><br />
The Whirlwind II design wheelchair passes these tests. Two such chairs were tested to, and passed, the ISO Standard tests, including the minimum 200,000 cycles on the two-drum durability tests [P10.4], and 6,666 cycle horizontal 50 mm (2 inch) drop test [P10.5]. In addition, thousands of Whirlwind chairs have been built to the established specifications, and are withstanding rigorous riding throughout the world. This attests to these tests being appropriate.</p>
<p>Therefore, passing the above static strength and impact tests is a good indicator of a chair&#8217;s ability to also pass the ISO Standard durability tests.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong><br />
It is recognized that passing the above strength and impact tests does not directly test fatigue failure of the structural materials or joints. For that reason it is recommended that chairs be built of materials that don&#8217;t become brittle with repeated flexing, and any welds or brazed joints be of high quality.</p>
<p>For example, the Whirlwind chair uses malleable (mild or low- carbon) steel for the frame and other mechanical parts. This steel experiences minimal work-hardening when flexed well below its elastic stress limit. Also, when parts are inadvertently over loaded, they will bend rather than break, thus, avoiding a catastrophic safety hazard. (For example, 16mm (5/8&#8243;) diameter low-carbon steel axle bolts are used.) Also, it is generally braze-welded (gas-welded with brass) because the steel at the joints has less tendency to become brittle, and a broken weld can be easily and reliably welded by local bicycle repair person.</p>
<p>The Whirlwind chairs have the design features needed by a large segment of the wheelchair riding public in developing countries. That is, they are designed for countries where the chairs will be used in both city and village environments where rough riding conditions exist. Also, the materials and techniques used to manufacture and repair the Whirlwinds are appropriate for these countries.</p>
<p>There are many good wheelchair designs, besides the Whirlwind, being manufactured. Also, shops trained to manufacture the Whirlwind often modify the design to meet requirements important to them or their customers. It is recommended that all current and future designs and modifications be strength and impact tested as suggested in this paper. Doing so should help improve the quality of wheelchairs.</p>
