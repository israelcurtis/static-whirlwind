The reboot is highly anticipated given the original’s success. The drama series is about a recently disabled homicide cop, Robert Ironside.  The show, now available to pre-screen on <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/530916">Hulu.com</a>, is scheduled to air Wednesday, October 2<sup>nd</sup> at 10 pm, follows the wheelchair-riding detective as he leads a hand-picked team of “specialist” crime solvers.<br />
Looking at the original Ironside wheelchair, it’s interesting to see how far wheelchair technology and style have progressed. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ironside-Composite-72dpi-rgb-300x1711.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-1167 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ironside-Composite-72dpi-rgb-300x1711.jpg" alt="Actor Blair Underwood, Golden Globe Award Nominee" width="456" height="170" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ironside-Composite-72dpi-rgb-300x1711.jpg 456w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ironside-Composite-72dpi-rgb-300x1711-300x112.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></a>Ironside’s new wheelchair, the RoughRider, is both stylish and active. The RoughRider’s rugged design and ability to go anywhere fits perfectly with Ironside’s determination to go where he has to go.</p>
<p>Checking out the shows’<a href="https://www.facebook.com/NBCIronside"> Facebook page,</a> we’re excited to see that the RoughRider’s sleek and sporty contours give both a bold and confident look to the rider; while its super-durable frame has even helped the show’s film crew use it for anchoring large cameras for close-up scenes.</p>

Thank you so much!&#8221;</em> &#8211; Jordan Ayers. </span></span>This past year, on Brent Ayers family’s trip to London and Paris they were able to see and do more with the use of their RoughRider.  Brent’s daughter, Jordan, typically rides a power chair.  Knowing they would need a manual chair, the family looked for alternative chairs that would allow Jordon to traverse in the older regions of the cities; where the bumpy streets and the lack of rider friendly amenities make the use of traditional wheelchairs unreliable. After some light searching, the Ayers came across Whirlwind and the RoughRider. The chair’s long wheelbase and large caster wheel design was ideal for navigating the cobblestone streets found in the older sections of town.  Whirlwind’s “Buy One, Give One” offer, which allows Whirlwind to provide a second chair in the developing world to an individual in need of mobility provided an additional incentive.</p>
<p><a href="http://216.172.184.37/~ab85381/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Jordan-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1147 alignright" src="http://216.172.184.37/~ab85381/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Jordan-2-300x200.jpg" alt="Jordan+2" width="342" height="228" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Jordan-2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Jordan-2-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Jordan-2-500x333.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Jordan-2.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px" /></a>Soon after, the family received their new chair and was off to Europe. During their time in London and Paris, the RoughRider’s rugged design came in handy when riding the busy streets of Europe. Since returning home, Jordan continues to use her RoughRider when charging her power chair. She enjoys how the RoughRider moves with minimal effort in comparison to other manual chairs she has owned. We at Whirlwind are happy to see how the RoughRider benefited the Ayers’ trip to Europe. We wish them many more memorable trips, and hope to hear from them again!</p>

<p><em>Fourth grade students selling sundaes to raise funds for their Wheels of Hope project for Whirlwind Wheelchair</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span class="thumbnail-caption" style="width: 700px;">Fourth grade students selling sundaes to raise funds for their Wheels of Hope project for Whirlwind Wheelchair. </span></span>In fall 2012, 100 fourth grade students from Indian Ridge Elementary School in the Cherry Creek school district of metro Denver, Colorado began raising funds for Whirlwind Wheelchair International as part of a project-based learning activity. The fourth graders chose Whirlwind Wheel International because of our mission to provide independent mobility to wheelchair riders in the developing world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They particularly liked the RoughRider’s unique design, extremely effective on all-terrain, and affordability. Past projects they have supported include: One Laptop per Child, the U.S. Forest Service’s restoration efforts in a large Colorado burn area, and water wells and ready-to-use therapeutic food in Niger, used in the treatment of children suffering of malnutrition. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Donna Shepherd, a fourth grade teacher at Indian Ridge spearheading the activity, says, “I use project-based learning to teach economics, research, writing, logic, civics, social studies, etc. in an across-the-curriculum approach to learning. I find that integrating curriculum is a powerful way to make learning meaningful and relevant to students.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She has found project-based learning enrichers their learning experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>“Often students come back years later and tell me that it was one of the most important experiences that they remember from elementary school. It is also a fun way to learn.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This year the students’ goal is to raise $20,000 through ice cream Sunday fundraisers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As of the end of January, Indian Ridge Students have raised $5,000 for Whirlwind Wheelchair.</p>
