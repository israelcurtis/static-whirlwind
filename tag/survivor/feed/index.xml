<p>Before this June, Sudardo, a 48-year old spinal cord injury survivor from Yogyakarta, Indonesia, was limited to his village and a few surrounding villages due to his difficulty in traveling.  In June, he received his RoughRider® and now collects 15 bags a week and provide for his wife, son and two daughters.  His RoughRider also allows him travel all the way to the nearby town’s center that is a few kilometers each way.</p>
<p>Whirlwind Wheelchair is joining the Giving Tuesday (Nov. 27<sup>th</sup>) inaugural efforts.  This holiday season, for each group of 20 people who give $10 each, a wheelchair user in Indonesia or Haiti will be able to more easily navigate his or her city or village, contribute to the family household and more fully participate in society.  Please contribute today by selecting to donate to the Giving Tuesday Program.</p>
