<p class="p1">The need for children’s wheelchairs in Haiti is great.  Our contacts on the ground tell us that even with all the aid pouring in there’s very little for kids with disabilities.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Vladimir, who meets Ralf, Whirlwind’s founder, in this video about our Haiti project in the summer of 2010, lost his mother and sustained a spinal cord injury in the earthquake. We encountered other kids who were injured in the earthquake, and others who have been struggling for years with disabilities like cerebral palsy and need additional postural support in their wheelchairs.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJQJ8pMsEcI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">For the past year, Matt McCambridge, Whirlwind’s new Manager of Product Development, has been developing a unique, rugged, pediatric chair that meets postural support needs. We are devoted to developing high-quality low-cost chairs for kids so that they have a safe, reliable means of getting to school and play even in the roughest of conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">In the best of times, there are scant resources available for these kids. Your donation will help fund the final development, manufacture, shipment, and custom adjustment of 250 wheelchairs for kids like Vladimir and others who need our new supportive chair. Please join us in our project to change the lives of children in Haiti through your tax-deductible contribution.</span></p>

<p>Transcription for this video: <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Haiti-Project-with-The-Walkabout-Foundation.pdf"><i class="fa fa-download " ></i> Haiti Project with The Walkabout Foundation</a></p>
<p>After the devastating Haiti earthquake of 2010, many Haitians suffered severe injuries, while much of much of the country&#8217;s infrastructure laid destroyed. Whirlwind recognized that there was a urgent need for the RoughRider wheelchair, which is specifically designed for rough terrain.</p>
<p>We offer our special thanks to the <a href="https://walkaboutfoundation.org/">Walkabout Foundation</a> and the other donors who made this project possible. Without you, we couldn&#8217;t have helped as many people as we did.</p>
<p><a href="https://walkaboutfoundation.org/about-us">Walkabout Foundation</a> is a non-profit organization that provides wheelchairs and rehabilitation in the developing world and funds research to find a cure for paralysis.</p>
<p>While the cure is being found, Walkabout Foundation seeks to provide humanitarian assistance to people with disabilities on the ground today by donating wheelchairs to people who can otherwise not afford one.</p>
<p>Walkabout Foundation donates the “RoughRider” wheelchair which is exclusively designed for the rough and rugged terrain of the developing world.</p>
<div class="bluColumn3">
<div class="camp3">
<p>In collaboration with our local partners, they are establishing a number of centres around the world to provide rehabilitation to children with mobility disabilities. These ‘Walkabout Centres’ provide daily physical and occupational therapy, care and education, with the aim of eventually integrating these children into mainstream or special education.</p>
