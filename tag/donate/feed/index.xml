<p>Endang, a wife and mother of a four and half year old son and four month old daughter, was born with what is believed to be Spina Bifida, though never officially diagnosed.  A singer by trade, Endang, was a member of a local group before going solo a year ago.  With the arrival of her daughter, she is taking a break from singing but looks forward to bringing her to different shows when she is old enough. Endang acquired a RoughRider in June and it has facilitated her ability to cook, clean, manage her home and take care of her children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="BasicParagraph">You can now make a donation and designate it for our VA Program. Whirlwind will make RoughRiders available to disabled veterans to test and provide valuable feedback through Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals around the country.   <a href="http://whirlwindwheelchair.squarespace.com/donate/">Donate Here</a></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Your donation of $800 will cover the cost of one RoughRider<strong><sup>®</sup></strong> for a veteran <em>and</em> a second RoughRider for someone in the developing world who otherwise could not afford one. Whirlwind will work with VA hospitals to identify well-matched recipients. We expect that the RoughRider will be well received, leading to VA purchases. And, by providing greater access to off-pavement adventures where most conventional wheelchairs cannot go, the RoughRider will open up more opportunities for veterans.</p>

<strong>Bob Incerti</strong><br />
<strong> Whirlwind&#8217;s SF Operations Manager</strong></p>
<p>As Bob Incerti, a Vietnam vet and Whirlwind’s San Francisco Operations Manager, puts it, “Returning to civilian life from the military is challenging. Returning with fewer abilities than you went in with makes the challenge harder. Having the right equipment can help veterans meet that challenge.”</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">“There are many wheelchair options—light, agile chairs for smooth surfaces, special chairs for various sports—that allow amazing participation. I often explain the RoughRider by saying, if I were to walk down a dirt road to a cabin in the woods with a road bike in one hand and a mountain bike in the other, the person in the cabin wouldn’t have to know anything about bikes to know that the mountain bike was more suited to their area.”</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">“I think of the RoughRider as the mountain bike of wheelchairs, allowing folks to get further down the road, where the fishing gets good and the woods are quiet.”</p>
