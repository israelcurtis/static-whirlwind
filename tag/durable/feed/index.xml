										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In 1988, Co-Founder Ralf Hotchkiss was in a bustling Zimbabwe outdoor market when two boys caught his attention. The two boys were pushing a two-wheeled cart whose wheels were unlike any wheels Ralf had ever seen before.  The wheels were extremely wide and flexible, allowing easy movement over the most uneven of roads.</p>
<p>Originally, the Zimbabwe wheel was manufactured with a large steel inner wheel wrapped in flexible rubber.  Whirlwind redesigned it to be made entirely of rubber, molded over a common bicycle hub, to provide better shock absorption.  Because the hub of the Whirlwind Zimbabwe Wheel uses bicycle bearings, it can be easily repaired throughout the developing world.</p>
<p class="p2">Now, after many trials and testings, the Zimbabwe wheel has become an easily repairable, lightweight and durable castor wheel unlike any other on the market.</p>
