<div id="_mcePaste">Whirlwind Wheelchair, based at SF State University, designs durable and highly functional wheelchairs that help riders to achieve maximum personal independence and integration into society.  Our chairs meet the needs of active wheelchair users in rough conditions because our founder and chief engineer is a 40-year wheelchair rider and because we have involved wheelchair riders in developing countries for more than 3 decades. US riders now benefit from the input of riders from around the world.  US rider feedback from our initial trial of the RoughRider® is overwhelmingly positive.</div>
