										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The main goal here at Whirlwind is to help people go where they want.  In Will Krajewski&#8217;s case this meant going with his Boy Scout troop to the  Boy Scouts of America National Jamboree, an event that only happens every four years.  Watch this incredible documentary below showing Will at the Jamboree motivating his troop and striving to help others.  This is an amazing story and we are sincerely blown away by Will&#8217;s strength and motivation.  We would like to thank WIll Krajewski and Scoutmaster Wes Forgey for sharing their story, as well as The Boy Project for putting together such a beautifully made short documenting it all.  Keep up the good work guys!</p>
