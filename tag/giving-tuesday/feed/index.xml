<p>Endang, a wife and mother of a four and half year old son and four month old daughter, was born with what is believed to be Spina Bifida, though never officially diagnosed.  A singer by trade, Endang, was a member of a local group before going solo a year ago.  With the arrival of her daughter, she is taking a break from singing but looks forward to bringing her to different shows when she is old enough. Endang acquired a RoughRider in June and it has facilitated her ability to cook, clean, manage her home and take care of her children.</p>
