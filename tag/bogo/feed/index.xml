<p class="BasicParagraph">Whirlwind is now taking advance orders for the RoughRider on our Buy One Give One (BOGO) program. Hundreds of wheelchair riders who have contacted us are excited about where they’ll go in their own RoughRiders.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">The RoughRider was designed to handle rough outdoor conditions like the broken up sidewalks and dirt paths commonly found in the developing world. Its long wheelbase makes it ultra-stable on uneven ground, making the RoughRider great for touring National Parks or for weekend excursions. <a href="/roughriderfun/">Watch videos of people out having fun in their RoughRiders in the San Francisco Bay Area.</a></p>
