<p>We recently received this post from Craig Pierson on Facebook “This Summer a group of us went to Masaka, Uganda to build a playground at Jireh Children&#8217;s Center. While there we met Fatuma. As you can see her wheelchair was in pretty rough shape. When we came back to the States I started a quest to find her a wheelchair that would better suit her needs with the rough terrain of Uganda. Here is her old wheelchair, and here is her new wheel chair. The smile tells it all.. — at Jireh Childern&#8217;s Center, Masake, Uganda.” Craig used <a href="http://216.172.184.37/~ab85381/programs/">Whirlwind&#8217;s Traveler&#8217;s program</a> to bring Fatuma a RoughRider.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing Craig we are glad she is enjoying her RoughRider!</p>
