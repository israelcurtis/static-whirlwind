<p class="Normaltext"><span style="color: windowtext;">Getting back to doing what you used to do can be one of the hardest hurdles for someone with a traumatic spinal cord injury. But Crystal Costa’s hard work, indomitable spirit, and her new Whirlwind RoughRider<sup>®</sup> are doing wonders. Crystal, an equestrian, was thrown from her horse while training for the upcoming Tevis 100 mile endurance race near her home in Cool, California. Although still partially paralyzed from the waist down, Crystal has worked hard to regain movement in her legs and is determined to continue doing what she loves to do. Her RoughRider makes much of that possible. </span></p>
<p class="Normaltext"><span style="color: windowtext;">Before her accident, Crystal would wake up early to feed her seven dogs, feed and groom her six horses, and then head off to the veterinary hospital that she managed. Crystal’s RoughRider not only allows her to navigate in and around her house. She can again go outside to feed her dogs and walk her horses. She was also able to attend a three-day tack sale and BBQ recently. At the tack sale Crystal noted, “the RoughRider is very easy to manage in the gravel and dirt, and going uphill and downhill, too.”</span></p>
