										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In December, Whirlwind&#8217;s Bob Incerti and Marc Krizack traveled with a team of Rotarians from Sacramento, CA to Iquitos, Peru to distribute 174 RoughRiders that were purchased with funds raised through a combined effort of 14 Sacramento area Rotary clubs.  The team of 9 included a retired emergency room doctor and a physical therapist.  The experience gave Whirlwind valuable feedback on small ways that the chairs could be improved to make them easier to assemble in the field.  Bob and Marc learned that Rotarians have found the formula for making the world a better place and having a good time while doing it.</p>
<p>For their efforts, Bob and Marc were honored with the <em>Paul Harris Award</em> by the Fair Oaks, CA Rotary Club on January 28th.  The Paul Harris Award is reserved for those who &#8220;<em>have made a significant contribution to advance world understanding, goodwill, and peace through the improvement of health, the support of education, and the alleviation of poverty</em>&#8220;.</p>
