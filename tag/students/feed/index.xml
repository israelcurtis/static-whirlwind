<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span class="thumbnail-caption" style="width: 700px;">Fourth grade students selling sundaes to raise funds for their Wheels of Hope project for Whirlwind Wheelchair. </span></span>In fall 2012, 100 fourth grade students from Indian Ridge Elementary School in the Cherry Creek school district of metro Denver, Colorado began raising funds for Whirlwind Wheelchair International as part of a project-based learning activity. The fourth graders chose Whirlwind Wheel International because of our mission to provide independent mobility to wheelchair riders in the developing world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They particularly liked the RoughRider’s unique design, extremely effective on all-terrain, and affordability. Past projects they have supported include: One Laptop per Child, the U.S. Forest Service’s restoration efforts in a large Colorado burn area, and water wells and ready-to-use therapeutic food in Niger, used in the treatment of children suffering of malnutrition. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Donna Shepherd, a fourth grade teacher at Indian Ridge spearheading the activity, says, “I use project-based learning to teach economics, research, writing, logic, civics, social studies, etc. in an across-the-curriculum approach to learning. I find that integrating curriculum is a powerful way to make learning meaningful and relevant to students.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She has found project-based learning enrichers their learning experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>“Often students come back years later and tell me that it was one of the most important experiences that they remember from elementary school. It is also a fun way to learn.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This year the students’ goal is to raise $20,000 through ice cream Sunday fundraisers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As of the end of January, Indian Ridge Students have raised $5,000 for Whirlwind Wheelchair.</p>

Members of San Francisco State’s Student Section of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) are working with Whirlwind on building a hand-powered front-wheel-drive tricycle as a club project. The club has been responsible for welding, fabricating, and contributing to the iterative design process through testing. “The team of undergraduate students is learning valuable skills to help their eventual careers in engineering,” says club president Nic Celeste, “while seeing first-hand how engineering and design can help make the world a better place for those with limited mobility.” The ASME Trike Project is overseen by Whirlwind product designer Aaron Wieler. It is one of several engineering and entrepreneurship projects that we are currently working on with students at San Francisco State, where our headquarters and shop are located.</p>
