<p><strong>RoughRider Wheelchair Assembly</strong></p>



<p>This video shows assembly instructions for the Whirlwind RoughRider wheelchair. For more detailed assembly instructions and information on service provision, see whirlwindwheelchair.org/roughrider-support.</p>



<p><strong>Tools.</strong></p>



<p>These tools are useful for assembly of the wheelchairs. (13, 19mm socket; 10, 13, 19mm wrench; + and – screwdrivers; mallet; pump)</p>



<p><strong>Unpacking the Wheelchair</strong></p>



<p>Unpack the box. Notice the cushion, user manual, backrest cover, caster wheels, accessory kit, pump, two rear wheels, and wheelchair frame.</p>



<p><strong>Caster Assembly</strong></p>



<p>To install the caster wheels, remove the nut from the caster stem and make sure the washer is installed between the fork and the wheelchair. Thread on the nut and tighten very firmly with a socket wrench or the socket provided in the toolkit. Make sure the caster spins freely. Tap the plastic caps in place with a wooden or rubber mallet.</p>



<p><strong>Rear wheels</strong></p>



<p>Remove the packing from the rear wheels. Be careful not to scratch the hand rim paint. Make sure the valve stem is straight. Inflate the tires. Inflate between 45 and 55 pounds per square inch (3 – 3.8 Bar). Replace the valve cap. Determine which axel position is required. Refer to whirlwindwheelchair.org/service for more information on measurements and wheelchair setup. Remove the axel bolt from the accessory bag. Remove the nut and spacer and insert the bolt so that the head is recessed in the hub. Install the spacer over the bolt and install the axel through the appropriate hole in the axel block. The hand rim should face away from the wheelchair frame. Install the nut. Tighten firmly with a 19mm wrench and socket. Make sure the wheel spins freely.</p>



<p><strong>Adjusting the brakes</strong></p>



<p>Remove the wrapping from the brakes. Slide the brake clamp to a position where the brake engages firmly with the tire, but is still easy to operate. Use a mallet if needed to move the brake clamp. Tighten the brake clamp with a 13mm wrench and make sure the brake can be engaged easily, holds the wheel when it is engaged, cannot be turned from side to side around the clamp, and that the brake handle can move without touching the wheelchair frame.</p>



<p><strong>Special Adjustment Rear Axle Position&nbsp;</strong>(5th&nbsp;axle position)<br>To use the rear axle hole, it may be necessary to remove the wedge from the brake clamp. First, install the wheels in the rear axle position. To remove this wedge, first position the clamp between the two curves on the wheelchair frame. Remove the nut from the brake clamp. Slide out the bolt, tapping with a hammer if necessary. Remove the wedge. Reinstall the clamp bolt with the flattened part facing downward towards the wheelchair tube. Adjust the clamp and tighten.</p>



<p><strong>Backrest Installation</strong></p>



<p>Remove the wrapping from the backrest straps. Swivel the backrest canes outward from the front of the chair towards the back. There are three backrest heights (High backrest; middle backrest; low backrest). The straps must be adjusted for each height. The straps are pre-installed for the high backrest height. To set up the backrest in the highest position, slide the backrest canes up until the bottom hole can be seen through the backrest hole. Install the hook and loop tab onto the backrest bolt, which can be found in the accessory bag. Make sure the softer “loop” part is facing out. Swivel the backrest cane slightly, or tap gently to make the installation easier. Tighten the backrest bolts with a 13mm socket and wrench while holding the backrest tab vertical. Make sure that none of the straps are too tight so as to prevent the wheelchair seat to be stretched tight when opened. Adjust all the back straps to be equally tensioned with the wheelchair fully opened.</p>



<p><strong>Backrest Cover</strong></p>



<p>Install the backrest cover as shown, with the logo on the back of the wheelchair and the wings fastened around the top of the backrest canes. There is a seam that should be positioned at the top of the wheelchair backrest. The backrest should lie flat and be even on all sides. Secure the two straps from the front and back of the cover, below the bottom backrest strap.</p>



<p><strong>Changing Backrest Height</strong></p>



<p>Fold the chair slightly. Remove the backrest bolts. There are three backrest height positions. The backrest cane and straps must be moved to change positions. For the highest position, use the bottom hole in the backrest cane and there will be two straps below the backrest bolt. For the middle position, use the center hole in the backrest cane and there will be three straps below the backrest bolt. For the lowest position, use the top hole in the backrest cane and there will be four straps below the backrest bolt. Detach the hook and loop on the backrest straps, unthread the buckles and reposition the straps as needed. There should always be two straps in the gap behind the fender. Insert the backrest bolt into the correct hole for the selected backrest height. Thread the backrest straps through two slots in the buckle, and secure the hook and loop tabs. Re-attach the hook and loop tabs and tighten the backrest straps so that all the straps are evenly tensioned while the seat is fully opened. Replace the backrest cover.</p>



<p><strong>Adjusting the Footrest Height</strong></p>



<p>To change the footrest height, loosen the footrest clamp bolt using a 13mm wrench and socket. Slide the footrest tube to the required height and tighten the clamp bolt. Make sure the bolt is tightened enough that the footrest does not rotate.</p>



<p><strong>Special Adjustment: Seat Extension.</strong></p>



<p>If a longer seat depth is needed, install the seat extension. On both sides of the seat, remove the front bolt in the seat with a Phillips screwdriver. It is under the hook and loop. Remove the plastic plugs. Remove the long bolt from the seat extension, and insert the seat extension in one side with the strap on the top. Slide the long bolt all the way through the seat extension and out the bottom of the seat tube. Install the lock nut on the bottom of the seat extension bolt, and tighten with a screwdriver and a 13mm wrench. Fold the chair slightly, and install the second seat extension. You can twist the seat extension slightly to help line up the holes. Finally, open the seat fully and detach the flap of the seat fabric from under the seat and stretch it over the strap. Re-attach with the hook and loop.</p>



<p><strong>Final check</strong></p>



<p>Fold and open the chair completely, and test-ride the chair. Refer to the RoughRider Assembly Manual for more information on assembly.</p>

As part of their Master’s thesis, Christian and Erik developed <em>Walter</em> &#8211; a rigid frame <em>wheelchair</em> for developing countries with the ability to <em>alter</em> the rider&#8217;s center of gravity while remaining seated in the chair. With two distinct seat positions, Walter offers riders three major advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enables riders to climb steeper ramps and hills by shifting the seat to the front position and thereby the riders center of gravity;</li>
<li>Facilitates transfers and allows riders to more easily approach a table when working, dining or just socializing with a more active (front) seating position; and</li>
<li>Maintains optimal stability on rough uneven terrain with Walter’s bucket seat angle, low seat height and aft seat position.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span class="thumbnail-caption" style="width: 250px;">Christian Bremer and Erik Ohlson with WALTER</span></span>The development of Walter has included wheelchair expertise and collaboration with wheelchair riders on four continents: field studies in Kenya, prototyping at our workshop in San Francisco, field trials in Indonesia, and project finalization in Sweden. Well received among both users and assistive technology professionals, <em>Walter</em> won first prize overall in RESNA’s 2013 Student Design Competition. We congratulate Christian and Erik on their user-centered, participatory design approach and their achievement. Working with them was both a fruitful learning experience, and interesting glimpse into the future of wheelchair design. We look forward to seeing the future development of <em>Walter</em>.</p>

Double Drum Test of an early RoughRider</span></span></p>
<p>Whirlwind is hosting the International Organization for Standards – ISO &#8211; (wheelchairs) Working Group Meetings from June 3 throug June 7, 2013 at San Francisco State University.  The Working Groups comprise representatives of industry and consumer groups who work to develop and design manufacturing standards for manual and power wheelchairs.</p>
<p>This year’s meeting is historic in that, for the first time, the ISO wheelchair meetings will include a day dedicated to advancing ISO wheelchair standards in developing countries. Experts in wheelchair provision in developing countries are aware, for example, that some of the current ISO standards are not stringent enough so that some chairs that pass the ISO tests still fail in day-to-day use in the developing world.  Some developing world experts feel that there is a need for additional or alternate tests and/or modifications to existing ISO test methods.  Appropriate standards combined with formal testing and widespread dissemination of results would go a long way to improve the quality of wheelchairs provided in developing countries and could help governments adopt appropriate national wheelchair standards.</p>
<p>On June 5, ISO working group members will meet with members of nearly a dozen organizations that work in the developing world.  The ultimate goal is to establish an official Working Group within ISO to develop standards appropriate for wheelchairs that will be used in the generally rougher environments of developing countries.</p>

<p>An avid hunter, Dennis Hein, 56, enjoyed getting outdoors in Billings, Montana. For several years, he shared his enthusiasm for hunting by teaching a Hunter Education class in one of the local middle schools. But, a couple of years ago, nerve damage affected Dennis’s ability to walk, causing him to need a wheelchair and to cut back on his time spent outdoors on trails and at the shooting range.</p>
<p>Last year, Dennis couldn’t teach the Hunter Education class because he couldn’t make it up the school’s access ramp in his old wheelchair, nor could he get his old wheelchair’s front wheels over the threshold. At the shooting range, he couldn’t sit in his wheelchair while shooting for fear of tipping over. Even when seated on a bench, he worried about losing his balance from his rifle’s recoil.</p>
<p>This year, things have changed. Shooting while seated in his RoughRider®, Dennis is more confident, knowing that his chair is stable and won’t tip over sideways. And, he’s once again teaching his Hunter Education class and going to the shooting range. “The chair just makes getting around a whole lot easier. I can get around in tight spaces easier and get over the rough spots much easier. I even attempted to go up a mountain bike path that I would not have attempted in my old chair.” Dennis is also thrilled that he can once again enjoy watching his granddaughters play softball and volleyball.</p>
