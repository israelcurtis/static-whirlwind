<p>Lack of mobility is only the first of many barriers that people with disabilities have to overcome in order to be able to fully participate in society. Perhaps no better example of this was on display in La Paz, Bolivia on February 23 when a large group of mobility impaired demonstrators confronted police at the end of a 3-month cross-country march.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">The march was in support of their demand that the government comply with a 2006 law that provides 6 million dollars for Bolivians with disabilities annually. They also demanded that people with mobility impairments receive the same monthly stipend that blind people receive. Following the clash, the Bolivian government agreed to the demonstrators’ demands. Whirlwind is pleased to see that our RoughRider wheelchair provided the mobility that demonstrators needed to be able to fight for their rights. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/video/2012/02/24/bolivias-disabled-clash-with-police-in-l?videoId=230692502&amp;videoChannel=2602">Watch a video of the confrontation with police.</a></p>
