<p><strong>Eric Logan – <em>WINNER of the ROUGHRIDER BEST PHOTO CONTEST!<br />
</em></strong>Eric’s photo was taken at Surigao del Norte in the Philippines. He won $50 USD OR free push handle extenders for every photo that we used in 2017 and 2018!</p>
<p><em>Here is what Eric had to say about his RoughRider:</em></p>
<p>Dear RoughRider,</p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="EN">I&#8217;m Eric Logan and I love your product! My photo was taken in Surigao del Norte, Philippine on the island of Mindanao.  That&#8217;s where I have used it for everything from a marathon to daily exercise or just getting around where there is no sidewalk.  I like challenging myself, so I look for the biggest hill, or mountain and try to go up and down it several times.  I have used this chair on the ocean bottom (really), where my wife family lives in Surigao. It bumps up against the China Sea, and at low tide, in some places, you can literally walk on the sea floor. You guys have a great chair and really half the world that needs a chair could really use one.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="EN">Thanks a lot for creating it!</span></p>
