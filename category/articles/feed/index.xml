										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After more than two years of extensive e orts, Whirlwind has managed to pull together the key partners for a major wheelchair project in Morocco. The project would support a social enterprise, called Peace Wheels that includes local wheelchair manufacture and assembly of imported RoughRiders® in conjunction with efforts to improve access to wheelchairs throughout the country.</p>
<p>The project is the brainchild of Salam Hassan, an Iraqi wheelchair rider and former Whirlwind wheelchair engineer. Salam is a US citizen. His wife Sara Tanzakkine is Moroccan and is a Whirlwind employee.</p>
<p>In September 2017, the project planning team visited Morocco for two weeks to meet with potential partners. We secured collaboration with White Dove, a disabled-run NGO in the northern city of Tetouan, on developing new wheelchair services in Morocco. Whirlwind requires that a local disability organization play a leading role in projects that we support. White Dove currently receives capacity building support from USAID and European Union projects. We contributed a Peace Wheels sports wheelchair and a RoughRider for a wheelchair technology exhibition sponsored by White Dove in Tetouan on Dec. 15, 2017.</p>
<p>The Rotary Club of Casablanca has agreed to purchase more than 300 wheelchairs annually and has expressed interest in collaborating with an American Rotary Club on a joint humanitarian project to meet the wheelchair needs of Moroccans with disabilities. Our partners at the Coalition for Independent Living in Tbilisi, Georgia, whose RoughRider factory is a model for the Moroccan project, will provide assembly line training and quality control to greatly increase the number of wheelchairs produced.</p>
<p>The Entraide Nationale du Maroc is the government agency responsible for purchasing wheelchairs for distribution to persons with disabilities in Morocco and they agreed to purchase 9,000 wheelchairs in 2017. Whirlwind statement with Faoud el Madani, General Director of L’Entraide Nationale, regarding the government’s commercial tender for purchasing wheelchairs and about their willingness to improve the functioning characteristics of the wheelchair specifications for their commercial tenders.</p>
<p>After our meeting, the Entraide Nationale agreed to collaborate on a future assessment survey that will get feedback from users on di erent types and models of wheelchairs. Currently, the government purchases only basic wheelchairs imported from China. One of the Morocco project’s goals will be to educate the government about the need for purchasing wheelchairs, which are appropriate for the rough environment in Morocco and to change the government’s current wheelchair provision policy. White Dove would implement the wheelchair assessment survey and the adoption of World Health Organization guidelines for wheelchair provision services.</p>
<p>USAID/Morocco’s new Democracy and Governance O cer, Jennifer Nikolae , met with our team in September at the US embassy in Rabat and expressed a willingness to administer any project that USAID- Washington would be willing to fund. Agreement of the in-country USAID o ce is a precondition for any USAID support for a disability project.</p>
<p>Whirlwind Wheelchair International wants to express its commitment to supporting and collaborating with<br />
Salam Hassan and Peace Wheels in Marrakesh. Whirlwind has followed Salam’s development in Morocco of a lightweight sports wheelchair and a newly invented hub-less wheelchair, as he begins to develop appropriate technology wheelchairs in Marrakesh, which can be manufactured at a low price from locally available materials with locally trained workers who have disabilities. In addition, we have agreed that Peace Wheels can also be the official distributor of RoughRider wheelchairs in Morocco and North Africa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Emergency Alert: Swedish Government Cutting Personal Support and Service for People with Disabilities</h3>
<p>There is an emergency alert situation emerging in Sweden. The Swedish Government  is cutting personal and support services for people with disabilities. They have launched an investigation of the LSS, (The Swedish Act concerning Support and Service for persons with certain functional impairments), with a clear focus on reducing the costs of personal assistance services. At the same time, they have given directives to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, that are to be seen as direct orders to reduce the LSS’s total costs. The total Government costs of personal assistance services are higher today but the Swedish disability movement and many researchers say that this cost increase has quite natural /wp-admin/post.php?post=2532&amp;action=edit#causes.</p>
<p>The Government claims, without waiting for or even ordering an analysis of the increased costs, is that this increase is due to fraud and abuse. Researchers now believe that the Government is using a cynical method of making politically sensitive savings in the welfare sector. The method of analysis, which the Government says indicates a major fraud or abuse of personal assistance services has been rejected by the research community as inappropriate to use for social science calculations and are based on estimates and not actual facts. In addition, the Government has used political rhetoric, which sets social groups against each other, by stating that the total cost of personal assistance services must be reduced in order to provide financial assistance to other population groups in society.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The directives from the Government are one problem. The second problem is the Swedish Social Insurance Agency’s application of the LSS law.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The provision of personal assistance financial support has a divided responsibility between the Government (Social Insurance Agency) and the local Municipality. In order to receive Government financed personal assistance services, an individual must require more than 20 hours of basic personal assistance needs per week. The Government currently identifies and counts the number of hours an individual requires in order to meet their basic needs. (These basic needs are usually independence-related and frequently include the necessary requirements of everyday life), DHR considers this Government system to be unnecessary and just a matter of political determination for which government level is responsible for paying the cost. However, we also argue that all personal assistance needs are independence-related and we also say it is impossible to estimate our future independence-related needs by the minute and seconds (that is really what they are requiring today). If an individual requires less than 20 hours of basic needs per week, then they are required to apply for personal assistance services locally through their Municipality.</p>
<p>Another big problem is that the Swedish Social Insurance Agency’s interpretations of past legal judgments creates an assumption in which fewer people are expected to be entitled to personal assistance services or they are expected to require less personal assistance hours than estimated before.  This assumption has serious consequences for the individual who needs personal assistance services in order to live in their own apartment instead of an institution. These individuals may be forced to stop working, a loss of personal assistance hours also affects families, and, in the worst case, this loss can also endanger the life of the individual. In practice, this pro-active reduction of personal assistance services by the Government risks jeopardizing the entire LSS law and thereby, reintroducing institutional thinking.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a draft report from the LSS investigation leaked out to the Swedish disability movement. If this report’s proposals become reality, it will means the end of personal assistance services in Sweden. Among other things, the report proposes that no personal assistance will be granted to children under the age of 12 or to elderly persons over 80 years of age. In Sweden, for many years, an individual has been able to retain their personal assistance services after the age of 65, but they will not be granted more hours after the age of 65. Even worse, it is recommended that no one will receive personal assistance services if they require less than 20 hours of basic needs. In addition, an individual will only receive 15 hours of other personal assistance services for activities outside the home, such as shopping, training or meeting friends.</p>
<p>Our Government actually feels no shame in publicly admitting that they want to save money on personal assistance services, and they justify this attempt at reduction of total costs, without proof I might add, by reporting that the trend of increasing costs is due to widespread fraud or abuse. On the contrary, research studies have indicated that cheating and abuse in personal assistance services is lower than in other types of financial support services funded by the Social Insurance Agency, but these other social services are not exposed to the same Government threat of cutbacks as personal assistance services.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Government’s actions directly contradict the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and they use methods and language that we did not think was possible a couple of years ago. There are also clear indications that Government cutbacks in personal assistance services has also cost human lives and have caused a major reduction in the quality of life for those individuals who have lost their personal assistance services.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This is the background explanation for my international distress call.</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, the problem first arose when media journalists, without personal disability experiences or a deep knowledge of personal assistance services, began to comment on a small number of Social Insurance Agency’s judgments that revealed fraud. DHR considers fraud and abuse in welfare obviously unacceptable but our Government panicked and responded with this collective punishment of all people in need of assistance.</p>
<p>It is clear to me that our Government is not prioritizing the rights of people with disabilities. We also feel that our rights to self-determination and equal participation in society are being challenged. I will also send to you a letter written to Catalina Devandas Aguilar, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>
<p><b>ACTION STATEMENT</b></p>
<p>Today, we are demanding that they stop the LSS investigation and restart their efforts to improve the law with new directives, in order to make any necessary changes to recreate this law in accordance to it´s initial purpose and intentions.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p><strong>Rasmus Isaksson,</strong></p>
<p><strong>President of Swedish Federation of People with Mobility Impairments – <a href="https://dhr.se/">DHR</a></strong></p>
<p><b>UPDATE: March 8, 2018</b></p>
<p>One new development is that the Minister in charge of coordinating the Government’s policy on disability rights resigned yesterday. She was given the new job of Deputy Secretary General of UN Women. However, I think that changing the Minister of Disability Rights will have no effect on potential Government cutbacks to personal assistance services since I fear that these directives to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency really comes from the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: March 11, 2018</strong></p>
<p>New development. There is an article in the newspaper about a very sick girl who had personal assistance. Because her illness got worse they applied for additional assistance. The social insurance agency declined her request and said that her needs to go to the bathroom should be taken care of  through her health care. These needs are something all people with disabilities have in my opinion it is not a health issue but a basic human need. Worse is that instead of granting her more assistance they threatened to remove her assistance entirely. Only after they had threatened the family to have their application canceled did  they agree to freeze the decision to remove her assistance.<br />
<b><br />
UPDATE: April 30, 2018</b></p>
<p>I thought I should let you know that today our government announced that they will change the directives to the investigation on personal assistance (LSS). The disability movement, including my own organization DHR, has criticized the former directives since they focused on cutting costs. Our new minister (replacing the former minister Ã…sa Regner, whom we had criticized) said that the investigator from now on shall not focus on cutting costs. Also, a new law is in place since 1st of April, which is meant to correct the results after several guided judgements had severe consequences for practice of the law.</p>
<p>Even though we don&#8217;t know the proposals that the investigator will put forward, we consider the last events as a success for the disability movement. We should celebrate our successes sometimes.</p>
<p>I am meeting with the government in a couple of weeks to talk about the problems within the area of adapted cars. This is another area where our government is trying to save money which have sever consequences for our right to mobility. At least we are in fighting spirit mode.</p>
<p>In May, we expect the ruling from the court in the discrimination case that we have started on behalf of our member. We already got a guided judgement as far as who should face the accusations, since the company that we are suing is using another company for the service. Now the case is back in court to rule if discrimination due to inadequate accessibility has occurred. The ruling is expected to take place late this month and we have a strong case. That is the first time in Sweden an organization for disabled people in Sweden is doing something like this so it will be huge for us. We are confident that we have a strong case.</p>
<p>These are a few updates from Sweden. Mostly good news~</p>
<p>Take care!</p>
<p><b>Rasmus Isaksson</b></p>
<p><strong>We encourage you to share this story as we try to raise awareness of this emerging situation.</strong></p>

After some light searching, the Ayers came across Whirlwind and the RoughRider. The chair’s long wheelbase and large caster wheel design was ideal for navigating the cobblestone streets found in the older sections of town.  Whirlwind’s “Buy One, Give One” offer, which allows Whirlwind to provide a second chair in the developing world to an individual in need of mobility provided an additional incentive.</p>

During their time in London and Paris, the RoughRider’s rugged design came in handy when riding the busy streets of Europe. Since returning home, Jordan continues to use her RoughRider when charging her power chair. She enjoys how the RoughRider moves with minimal effort in comparison to other manual chairs she has owned. We at Whirlwind are happy to see how the RoughRider benefited the Ayers’ trip to Europe. We wish them many more memorable trips, and hope to hear from them again!</p>

<p><em>Father Thomas outside a classroom at Sacred Heart Seminary in Mubende, Uganda. </em>For nearly 30 years, Whirlwind has been dedicated to improving the lives of people with disabilities in the developing world. We recently received an update from Father Thomas Gabula, a Catholic Priest in Uganda, and avid user of the RoughRider. In October 2009, barely three months after his ordination, Father Thomas was in a motorbike accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down and unable to fulfill his duties with the Church. Through the generosity of sponsors, he was given the opportunity to receive rehabilitation therapy at <a href="http://www.shepherd.org/">Shepherd Center</a>; an Atlanta, Georgia based non-profit hospital, which specializes in the medical treatment and rehabilitation of people with spinal cord injuries.</p>
<p>Help was first reached out to Father Thomas through sisters Mary Goss and Connie Kay. Connie had previously attended Shepherd Center, while Mary is Director at Catholic Relief Services, which partners with a diocese in Uganda. Through their hard work, the two sisters were able to start the process of arranging Father Thomas’ rehab trip to the United States. Furthermore, Darci Pernoud, an Occupational Therapist at the Shepherd Center, served as Thomas’ caregiver during his month’s stay. Recognizing that a traditional hospital wheelchair would not hold up against the rugged conditions in Uganda, Darci contacted Whirlwind about getting Father Thomas a RoughRider.</p>
<p>After his month of therapy, Father Thomas had learned many new skills that allowed him to be nearly independent.  He now has the freedom to live an active life and return to his work with the Church. When we talked with Father Thomas, he happily mentioned the many things he can now do with Whirlwind’s all-terrain wheelchair.  At the Sacred Heart Seminary in Mubende, outside Kampala, he teaches classes on the Bible and Latin, and is able to traverse most of the uneven and stony terrain when traveling to the different classes, chapels and churches. He also enjoys getting out into the community and working with parishioners.  He is committed to helping other Ugandans with disabilities and sharing what he learned at the Shepherd Center.  We wish him all the best, and look forward to hearing from him in the future.</p>

As part of their Master’s thesis, Christian and Erik developed <em>Walter</em> &#8211; a rigid frame <em>wheelchair</em> for developing countries with the ability to <em>alter</em> the rider&#8217;s center of gravity while remaining seated in the chair. With two distinct seat positions, Walter offers riders three major advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enables riders to climb steeper ramps and hills by shifting the seat to the front position and thereby the riders center of gravity;</li>
<li>Facilitates transfers and allows riders to more easily approach a table when working, dining or just socializing with a more active (front) seating position; and</li>
<li>Maintains optimal stability on rough uneven terrain with Walter’s bucket seat angle, low seat height and aft seat position.</li>
</ol>

To go along with Joe’s active lifestyle, his family chose Whirlwind’s RoughRider®.  While Joe’s other chairs got stuck going over even small cracks in the sidewalk, the RoughRider allows him to navigate grass and some gravel enabling him to enjoy some of his favorite outdoor places.  <span class="gd">Executive Director of Push to the Finish, </span>Andrew <span class="gd">McMahon says,</span> “Joe must&#8217;ve said ‘I love it. I love it,’ five times that day when asked about his chair.”</p>
<p>Joe broke-in his new chair at the race on June 22.  While Joe has been in several races before, this was the first race of the season for Joe and by far his smoothest ride yet.  He finished in 27 minutes with the assistance of Andrea Foxx.</p>
<p>Way to go Joe! We look forward to hearing about more of your outdoor adventures!</p>

Double Drum Test of an early RoughRider</span></span></p>
<p>Whirlwind is hosting the International Organization for Standards – ISO &#8211; (wheelchairs) Working Group Meetings from June 3 throug June 7, 2013 at San Francisco State University.  The Working Groups comprise representatives of industry and consumer groups who work to develop and design manufacturing standards for manual and power wheelchairs.</p>
<p>This year’s meeting is historic in that, for the first time, the ISO wheelchair meetings will include a day dedicated to advancing ISO wheelchair standards in developing countries. Experts in wheelchair provision in developing countries are aware, for example, that some of the current ISO standards are not stringent enough so that some chairs that pass the ISO tests still fail in day-to-day use in the developing world.  Some developing world experts feel that there is a need for additional or alternate tests and/or modifications to existing ISO test methods.  Appropriate standards combined with formal testing and widespread dissemination of results would go a long way to improve the quality of wheelchairs provided in developing countries and could help governments adopt appropriate national wheelchair standards.</p>
<p>On June 5, ISO working group members will meet with members of nearly a dozen organizations that work in the developing world.  The ultimate goal is to establish an official Working Group within ISO to develop standards appropriate for wheelchairs that will be used in the generally rougher environments of developing countries.</p>

The fourth graders chose Whirlwind Wheel International because of our mission to provide independent mobility to wheelchair riders in the developing world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They particularly liked the RoughRider’s unique design, extremely effective on all-terrain, and affordability. Past projects they have supported include: One Laptop per Child, the U.S. Forest Service’s restoration efforts in a large Colorado burn area, and water wells and ready-to-use therapeutic food in Niger, used in the treatment of children suffering of malnutrition. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Donna Shepherd, a fourth grade teacher at Indian Ridge spearheading the activity, says, “I use project-based learning to teach economics, research, writing, logic, civics, social studies, etc. in an across-the-curriculum approach to learning. I find that integrating curriculum is a powerful way to make learning meaningful and relevant to students.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She has found project-based learning enrichers their learning experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>“Often students come back years later and tell me that it was one of the most important experiences that they remember from elementary school. It is also a fun way to learn.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This year the students’ goal is to raise $20,000 through ice cream Sunday fundraisers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As of the end of January, Indian Ridge Students have raised $5,000 for Whirlwind Wheelchair.</p>

<p>Last week we shared a photo of Sri Lestari, a social worker who is employed by a Whirlwind partner, <a href="http://www.ucpwfh.org/">UCP Wheels for Humanity</a>, in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.  We found out after our post that she has been asked to speak at the<a href="http://tedxubud.com/"> TEDx Ubud</a> conference on June 1st.   Sri is hoping to make her trip to Ubud a much richer experience by traveling from Jakarta to Ubud on her modified motorbike increase awareness and share her experiences with others in the disabled community along the way.</p>
<p>I asked Sri what motivated her to make this trip (almost 750 miles) on motorbike. She responded with the following:</p>
<p><em>“Since I work in UCP Wheels for Humanity 2009, I visit more disable who just stay at home.  They are happy when they see me, because I am disabled, I am a women and I can work. I really want to share my experience how can be life independence and healthy as disabled (paraplegic).<br />
“The campaign really important because disabled in Indonesia still difficult to get out from their houses because no access, especially for public transportation.  My live change since I have modified motorcycle.</em></p>
<p>“Most people didn’t trust me when I told them that I am paraplegia, they surprise I can live independently, go everywhere by myself on the modified motorcycle and can work. When I do social assessment with the paraplegic, at the beginning they don’t believe me, after I talk deeply about paraplegic they are more open, when I told them that I can ride the modified motorcycle they smiling, I am so happy can make them smiling, after that they will contact me regularly and more deeply asking how can be independent specially for our daily live and get a job and they invite me to visit them with my motorcycle.</p>
<p>“Each time there are new paraplegic in my hometown some friends will tell me to visit them, mostly family who has disabled very happy when I visit them. Some of them  are desperate  to support the disabled  to have more spirit, because the disabled  will said that you are not feel what I am feeling, but when I talk to them they won’t refuse me, because I just like them.</p>
<p>“Some Mom who has children with disability said that, they want they children can be like me, even be diffable person but still can work.</p>
<p>“I am happy because I can work n earn money, so I can do home visit to my paraplegia friends in my home town or Yogyakarta in the weekend, share my experience n give them motivation.</p>
<p>“But I also want to share out of my home town and out of Yogyakarta, so that why I really more supported to do the trip.</p>

<p>With the 2010 Whirlwind RoughRider® on track to reach more than 20,000 riders next year, the process for ensuring that each chair is of the highest quality becomes an even greater challenge. Unlike Whirlwind’s first 25 years, it is no longer cost-competitive for one person to hand-make every RoughRider from start to finish. Now, as we expand into mass production, Whirlwind and our partners must streamline the production process to create experts in the manufacture of specific wheelchair parts and collaborate to make a great product. Whirlwind’s development of complex quality control systems is emblematic of our transition from a traditional nonprofit to a social enterprise capable of delivering unique, top quality products to tens of thousands of riders in need all over the world.</p>
<p class="Normaltext">Whirlwind is working with our overseas manufacturing facilities, ensuring that design specifications, change processes, and production methods yield the highest quality product possible. To achieve this, the Whirlwind tech team has developed formal processes for controlling quality, managing design changes, and effectively tracking customer complaints to continually improve the RoughRider. International standards guide Whirlwind and our producer-partners to create and implement QC systems effective in managing high-volume, industrial manufacturing applications around the world.</p>
