<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dear Friends and Supporters,</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile-150x150.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-9559" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile-150x150.jpeg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile-100x100.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>As we reported in 2021, Whirlwind is focusing on providing technical assistance to the small-scale businesses who are manufacturing and selling RoughRider wheelchairs. During 2022, the Whirlwind engineering team of Ralf Hotchkiss, Levan Talakhadze and Salam Hassan has been providing technical assistance to 3 RoughRider wheelchair businesses: the ARSOBO factory in Nogales, Mexico, the Fundación Bertha O. De Osete I.A.P. factory located in San Juan del Río, Querétaro, México, and the KIFAS factory in Ankara, Turkey.</p>



<p>Ralf and Levan evaluated a 2007 model RoughRider wheelchair from ARSOBO and identified several issues, which could be improved in their manufacturing and quality control process. This evaluation led to a visit by Levan to ARSOBO in Nogales, Mexico for two weeks, in order to help implement some of these fabrication improvements. You can read about his technical assistance visit in more detail in this newsletter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ralf and Levan also evaluated a 2007 model RoughRider and a standard hospital wheelchair from the Fundación Bertha O. De Osete, which is operating a medium size factory in San Juan del Río, Mexico. Ralf was especially excited about examining their standard hospital wheelchair as it is a much lighter and a simpler wheelchair design. Helping these businesses also means that Whirlwind’s engineers get to learn from their technical innovations and production solutions. Whirlwind will continue its technical assistance to the Fundación Bertha O. De Osete in 2023.</p>



<p>Whirlwind also provided technical assistance this year to KIFAS in Ankara, Turkey by sending Salam Hassan to: provide training for their new welders, improve their RoughRider production fixtures, and to strengthen their quality control processes. Specifically, Ken Eriksen, the founder and CEO of KIFAS, had asked for help in purchasing new welding equipment, a welding table and tube bending dies. Afterwards, Ken told me how happy he was to have Salam working with his team as he challenged them to think in new ways about how to create jigs or when he taught them how to make low-cost basketball wheelchairs. In December, Whirlwind received an email request from a disability organization in Ukraine who wanted to purchase basketball wheelchairs for rehabilitation and sport activities for their newly disabled Ukrainian veterans and we introduced them to KIFAS and Salam.</p>



<p>Our efforts to collaborate with NIOION Technologies Company, Ltd. based in Jiangsu, China in the development of an electric Roughrider using recent electric bicycle technology did not make any progress during this year due to a 2-month lockdown of Shanghai and nearby cities because of Covid. These repeated city-wide lockdowns have interrupted the normal functioning of local businesses and thereby disrupted our collaboration efforts to identify and evaluate new technical solutions. We are optimistically hoping to re-establish communications and to make some progress with an electric RoughRider as China’s businesses re-emerge from these lockdowns.</p>



<p>Whirlwind will continue to provide technical assistance and support to these RoughRider businesses in 2023 with your donations, which helps to keep us alive. Please consider making a generous large or small donation so that we can continue to provide the best wheelchair for the most difficult living conditions in the world.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With gratitude,&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="360" height="480" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Side-frame-improvement-360x480.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9937" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Side-frame-improvement-360x480.jpg 360w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Side-frame-improvement-900x1200.jpg 900w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Side-frame-improvement-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Side-frame-improvement-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Side-frame-improvement.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Levan modifying the side frame jig</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Levan began his visit in late October by examining how the ARSOBO RoughRider production process was organized and by inspecting the operating condition of the major equipment: drill press, welding torch, lathe machine and the production jigs.</p>



<p>The lathe machine was loose so Levan took it apart, cleaned it and then put it tightly back together so that it now works correctly. He also took apart and cleaned the welding torch and then advised Gabriel, the Chief Engineer, to lower the electricity power and the speed of the flux wire to improve the quality of the welding. Levan always worked directly with Gabriel while demonstrating how to weld with lower power. He also advised Gabriel to purchase a new copper head for the welding torch, where the flux wire comes out, and by making those changes the quality of the welding would greatly improve.</p>



<p>Another issue he identified was that the sockets for the X-brace were not aligned correctly during welding and they created a small gap next to the side frame, which could be fixed by a better welding technique on a lower power. While examining a RoughRider side frame, Levan noticed that they were using four different sizes of tubing. One of his recommendations for improving the fabrication process was to change the production jigs, so that they only used two sizes of tubing for a side frame.</p>



<p>When a wheelchair is completed, a worker can test the alignment of the side frames of the wheelchair by giving it a small push forward to see if the finished RoughRider rolls in a straight line. While conducting this test on an ARSOBO wheelchair, Levan could see that the 2 side frames were not perfectly aligned, so he made a few small fixes in the production jigs and now the side frames match equally. Levan recommended that new RoughRider production jigs be created in 2023, which would use only 2 tube sizes for the side frames and be perfectly aligned.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Front-forks-edited-480x480.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9939" width="240" height="240" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Front-forks-edited-480x480.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Front-forks-edited-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Front-forks-edited-768x768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Front-forks-edited-600x600.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Front-forks-edited.jpg 938w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></figure></div>


<p>After watching Gabriel forcing a bearing into a front caster barrel, Levan measured the tube diameter of the caster barrel and discovered that it was .5 cm smaller than the bearing, which made it very difficult to correctly insert the bearing. This fitting problem can be resolved by using a slightly larger sized tube for the caster barrels and will be further stabilized by inserting a spacer between the two bearings inside the caster barrel.</p>



<p>Levan also demonstrated how to make a lighter and stronger front caster fork using steel tubing that is bent into the correct shape and the ends are flattened for attaching to the bicycle axles of the Zimbabwe wheel.</p>



<p>Regarding the backrest upholstery, currently ARSOBO is using three straps to support the backrest fabric and only one metal buckle. Levan recommended that they use 2 metal buckles and showed them how the 2 metal buckles will lock and strengthen the 3 support straps. Whirlwind has always recommended using car seat belts for support straps because they are very strong and easily available to purchase.</p>



<p>Whirlwind conducted an exit zoom meeting with Levan, Kiko, Gabriel, Ralf, and Bruce to present Whirlwind’s findings and recommendations for improvement. Duke, the ARSOBO Board Chairperson, reviewed the zoom meeting and agreed to implement Levan’s recommendations for creating new wheelchair production jigs, purchasing new tools, and for the expansion of the RoughRider production space, which will improve the efficiency of the workstations and will add storage for the finished wheelchairs. ARSOBO will welcome any donations to assist them with implementing these capital improvements.</p>

<p>In September 2022, Whirlwind received an email from Steve Williams in Uganda, asking for technical assistance and an invitation to visit Ralf’s workshop in Oakland, California. What came as a surprise was his photo of a bamboo wheelchair, which he had been developing for a couple of years with ongoing technical assistance from businesses and factories in England, America and from Dr. Jon Perlman at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>



<p>In 1981, Ralf and Bruce were both aware of the attempt by Handicapped International to create a bamboo wheelchair in the Thailand refugee camps on the Cambodia border. Both of them were invited to the 1981 founding of Disabled People International, which was being held in Singapore during the United Nations International Year of the Disabled Persons. Ralf conducted a DIY workshop on how to make an appropriate technology wheelchair in the parking garage of the conference hotel. Using the wheelchair that Ralf had just built, Bruce traveled on to Thailand to visit the Cambodian refugee camp and to investigate the functionality of Handicapped International’s bamboo wheelchairs. The bamboo technology they used was not very sophisticated and after personally testing their bamboo and wood wheelchair, Bruce said that it was too heavy and was functionally difficult to use. For the last 40 years, we have both been unaware of any successful prototype of a wheelchair constructed primarily of bamboo.</p>

<p>Founded in 2014, <a href="http://www.kyaningacdc.org/">KYANINGA CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTER</a>, which currently employs 85 staff and serves approximately 1000 children a month. He also manages <a href="http://www.kyaningamobility.org/">KYANINGA MOBILITY</a>, which designs, tests, develops and manufactures wheelchairs, standing devices, seating apparatuses, prosthetics, and other mobility equipment, primarily using local bamboo.</p>



<p>Steve said, “We have traveled down a number of paths to solve the joint problem. The bamboo itself is very strong. We realized a solution could be to use more bamboo, which is very inexpensive and available. We have been testing the joints through a series of bamboo trailers pulled on the back of our vehicles (Dr. Jon Pearlman’s idea), and we are building a carousel testing machine. It has been a long journey and has ended up with a very simple solution (we are hoping it’s true that simplicity is complexity resolved). We essentially fill just the end of the bamboo with more bamboo, (a mechanical machine is being developed to make the process quick and easy) and together with the use of bamboo webs, we feel we have created a very cheap and strong frame.”</p>



<p>Steve arrived in San Francisco at the end of September and spent a week meeting with Ralf in his workshop while discussing various technical problems that he was trying to solve with casters, axles, upholstery, bamboo water damage and the use of bicycle technology. Bruce Curtis also had several meetings with Steve regarding publicity, potential donors, scalability, replication and the sustainability of his bamboo assistive technology model and networking with local and international supporters.</p>

<p>Steve is now back in his home in Port Royal, Uganda and is implementing some of the technical solutions provided by Ralf, in his next prototype of a bamboo wheelchair. Whirlwind is interested in the possibility of Archy Gomba, who lives very close on the east side of Lake Victoria in Tanzania, possibly visiting KYANINGA MOBILITY in order to share his experience of creating solar powered tricycles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">International Children with Disabilities Protection Act of 2022&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Republican Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, has introduced the International Children with Disabilities Protection Act. <strong>Senate Bill No. 4982</strong> will establish a small grants program of $10 million per year over five years at the US Department of State’s Office of Democracy, Rights, and Labor for people with disabilities and families of children with disabilities working to bring about policy and program reforms in their own countries. The bill also includes funding for an international training program to support effective community inclusion and deinstitutionalization of children with disabilities.</p>



<p>Joining Senators Menendez and Moran in cosponsoring the legislation are <strong>Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/protection-act.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9948" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/protection-act.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/protection-act-480x270.png 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/protection-act-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>According to UNICEF, there are at least 240 million children with disabilities globally, many of whom are left abandoned in institutions. Currently, there is no focused U.S. program to advance support for disabled children’s specialized needs, advocate for common-sense international policy reforms, and to promote the full inclusion of children as full-fledged members of society within loving families. This legislation aims to create a small-grants program—implemented by global disability rights NGOs—to support children with disabilities, and improve the capacity of local organizations of persons with disabilities and families of children with disabilities to advocate for necessary reforms.</p>



<p><strong>Sec. 2. Findings&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This section details the scope of needs related to protecting children with disabilities worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Sec. 3. Sense of Congress</strong></p>



<p>This section reiterates support to end stigma and discrimination by assisting organizations of persons with disabilities and family members of persons with disabilities.</p>



<p><strong>Sec. 5. Statement of Policy</strong></p>



<p>U.S. policy is to assist countries in creating rights protections programs for people with disabilities and to promote laws and policies that strengthen family support systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Sec. 6. International Children with Disabilities Protection Program.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Establishes a grant program within the State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor to assist organizations of persons with disabilities and families of children with disabilities to advocate for policies promoting family inclusion and to support independent living. Authorizes the Secretary of State to provide funds to NGOs to develop capacity-building programs to support advocacy efforts and advance policy reforms. <em>Authorizes $2 million in funds for FY 24 and $10 million for each fiscal year after from FY25 to FY29</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Sec. 7. Briefings and Reports on Implementation.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Requires an annual briefing and a report every three years to relevant congressional committees.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Sec. 8. Promoting International Protection and Advocacy for Children with Disabilities.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Emphasizes that programming implemented by the State Department and USAID should include the perspectives of organizations of persons with disabilities and seek to keep families united, when possible, including in conflict settings.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Whirlwind Provides Assistance to Wheelchair Riders</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Whirlwind often receives requests from wheelchair riders who need a good wheelchair for going outside in the real world but cannot afford to pay the high prices for wheelchairs. Because Whirlwind no longer sells wheelchairs, we refer potential customers to our partners that do, such as ARSOBO, a non-profit organization located in Nogales, Arizona/Mexico or to a private business, Roughrider America.</p>



<p>We have sometimes received a few donated scooters, power wheelchairs or manual wheelchairs and we have donated this equipment to those wheelchair riders who needed it. In February, Whirlwind received an email request from 21 year-old Katie Vazquez in Queens, New York City, who had severe fibromyalgia and needed a wheelchair that could go outdoors into the rough terrain of NYC. Katie had no income and when she left the hospital in 2021, she was given a Drive manual wheelchair, which was very hard for her to maneuver and she could not go outside without someone pushing her. Whirlwind sent our last RoughRider wheelchair to her and after receiving it she was able to go outside and begin to live more independently in NYC.</p>

<p>In May, Whirlwind received an email from Nilvio Charles about his ex-wife, 36 year-old Ramona Benua who lives in the Dominican Republic. She currently had a plastic wheelchair, which required pushing help from a relative in order to go outside her home. However, Ramona wanted a scooter so she could go by herself to church and to her physical therapy appointments. Therefore, Whirlwind sent a donated scooter to Nilvio in New York and he sent it to Ramona in Santo Domingo with his friend who was traveling there by airplane. Now she is going outside by herself and enjoying a more independent life.</p>



<p>A former customer, Ann McColl of North Carolina, happily found that she no longer needed her RoughRider after a successful spinal surgery. Ann wanted to donate her chair to someone who wanted to get out into the woods like she had.</p>



<p>In November, Whirlwind had received a request from a young man, Adam Klett in Knoxville Tennessee, with a spinal cord injury at T2 with multiple spinal screws, whose current wheelchair was falling apart and unsafe to use. He said he was outdoors a lot and needed a more durable wheelchair in order to have an active everyday life but could not afford to purchase a Roughrider wheelchair because he was on a fixed, poverty income. We immediately contacted Ann and she was willing to box up her RoughRider wheelchair for Adam and Whirlwind paid the shipping for the RoughRider wheelchair to arrive at Adam‘s home.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dear Friends and Supporters,</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile-150x150.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-9559" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile-150x150.jpeg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile-100x100.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>During 2021, Whirlwind returned to its roots of assisting small-scale RoughRider wheelchair factories, which we helped to establish during the last 40 years. Some of these smaller RoughRider businesses did not survive because of local economic conditions, management issues and the lack of support from their Ministries of Health, which preferred to purchase $90-$100 institutional wheelchairs from China’s megafactories through government tenders. </p>



<p>The economic survival of these small wheelchair businesses depends on convincing local buyers that the RoughRider wheelchair, which is made with mild steel, will last 15 years in harsh living conditions and is cheaply repairable with bicycle parts and at local welding shops. However, many of the riders who have some money prefer the light-weight sports wheelchairs with flashy colors and modern detailing, while the families and individuals who are poor take the free wheelchairs distributed by international charities and churches, regardless of the quality and repairability of the free wheelchairs. These are two of the reasons for small RoughRider businesses not having enough customers to keep their businesses economically viable.</p>



<p>In order to keep these businesses alive by selling their wheelchairs, many of our partners need to improve the quality of their RoughRider. Therefore, Whirlwind has started providing technical assistance to 3 RoughRider wheelchair businesses: the ARSOBO factory in Nogales, Mexico, the Fundación Bertha O. De Osete I.A.P.<br>factory located in San Juan del Río, Querétaro, México, and the KIFAS factory in Ankara, Turkey. Whirlwind<br>has asked the two RoughRider businesses in Mexico to send us their wheelchairs, which will be analyzed by Ralf Hotchkiss and Levan Talakhadze for their production quality and for recommendations on how to improve the production quality control in each factory. Salam Hassan, a wheelchair designer, volunteered to help Ken Erickson, owner/manager of the KIFAS factory in Turkey, restart his wheelchair production after closure during the Covid quarantine and the loss of his senior welder. Salam was sent in December by Whirlwind to KIFAS to help improve the welding fixtures for their RoughRider, improve quality control, and to train their new Iraqi welder.</p>



<p>Another important development in 2021 has been our recent attempt to create a low cost, full power electric RoughRider using new hub motor technology from China. We were not happy with our first attempt, which was implemented 10 years ago in the Republic of Georgia, because the older hub motor technology was heavy and required frequent repairs. As you will see in this newsletter, we are cautiously optimistic about our prototype efforts in collaboration with NIOION TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD, which is based in Jiangsu, China.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Peter Pfaelzer, cofounder of Whirlwind died in 2021. Peter was fundamental to the development and success of Whirlwind. We will miss his spirit, ingenuity and persistence in pursuing our goals. Finally, we want to thank all of our friends and generous supporters who share our values in a well designed, highly functional and locally repairable RoughRider wheelchair, which has become the best wheelchair for the worst conditions</p>



<p>we encounter as we go out into the world. Whirlwind is committed to always improving the functionality of our RoughRider so that even more people will experience the joy of being alive and realizing their best dreams in the beauty of the world outdoors for themselves, their children and for their elderly relatives. Please help us to continue helping others live their life as fully as possible in this world and with as much happiness as possible.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With gratitude,&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b><a id="recipients"></a>Safety First, Second and Third</b></h2>



<p>When Whirlwind was formed in 1980, it was well known that many wheelchair riders got hurt (some seriously) when they rode outdoors. I had a 24-year history of falling once or twice a year, either forward or backward. With the forward falls came broken bones; with the backward falls, concussions. Ralph Nader, with whom I had worked on safety issues through the 1970s, urged earnest attention to the grave dangers of wheelchair design. Ralph Nader’s input, and his support, continues to this day. And I, along with my fellow riders and designers in Whirlwind’s network, am dead serious about designing our chairs to be as stable and safe as they can possibly be.<br>By 1990 we had greatly increased the strength of our chairs, making the common failures of critical parts a thing of the past. Safety First! Backward tipping, unfortunately, was still as bad as ever. It seemed that every solution we created brought problems to other aspects of how the wheelchair functioned.</p>



<p>But Whirlwind’s cofounder, Peter Pfaelzer, gave Whirlwind a challenge that has kept us busy ever since. Our group had lost its focus; we were trying to solve too many problems at once. Peter proposed that we first learn as much as possible about when, and why wheelchairs fail. We knew from experience that injuries to wheelchair riders were quite common. But little was known about whether the incidents and the injuries came primarily from tips and falls, from chairs breaking down, or from other factors.</p>



<p>Because so many active people ride (and crash) their wheelchairs in the San Francisco Bay Area, we found it easy to learn from them how and why these crashes occur, and what injuries resulted. A Whirlwind team led by Ronny Gall spread the word in the community that we were looking for wheelchair riders who had crashed their chairs. Of the 252 incidents that we found, most, 42%, were tips or falls, while 33% were chair equipment failures. The riders in 27% of the incidents required medical treatment. 13 riders (5%) required hospitalization.</p>



<p>The most common injuries came from tips and falls, either in the forward or the backward direction. Forward falls damage more people, so we chose to concentrate on forward falls. This concentrated work paid off with the much longer wheelbase of the RoughRider. Now the RoughRider has virtually no forward tipping problem. Second major Safety Problem solved!</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ralf-1970-anti-tip-web.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="281" height="300" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ralf-1970-anti-tip-web-281x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9567" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ralf-1970-anti-tip-web-281x300.jpg 281w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ralf-1970-anti-tip-web-959x1024.jpg 959w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ralf-1970-anti-tip-web-768x820.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ralf-1970-anti-tip-web-500x534.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ralf-1970-anti-tip-web.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>That leaves us with the problem of backwards falls. Whirlwind and others have struggled to eliminate the problem of backwards tipping by using wheelie bars. Some worked quite well, but all shared a common problem: wheelie bars stick out behind, getting in the way when the chair and its rider need to be pulled up or bounced down stairs.<br>By the 1970s, I had a wheelie bar that was easily folded up and put out of the way. However, one day I was trying to get into the New York subway when a strong person offered to bounce me down the stairs. All went well until we reached the bottom of the stairs. I thanked him heartily, gave a strong forward push to my chair, and my head fell backward onto the solid concrete.</p>



<p>Needless to say we changed our design criteria immediately. From that day forward any retractable wheelie bar was required to re-deploy itself, by itself, before the chair could safely roll forward again.<br>Such a wheelie bar must be light, cheap and very safe. I have built several and some work well, but not yet well enough. If we can solve this retractable wheelie bar problem, we will have Safety First, Safety Second, and Safety Third!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b><a id="grandmother"></a>Do You Want To Help This Start Up Mobility Business In Tanzania?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h2>



<p>Archy Gomba, Founder and Director of the Shirati for Active Rehabilitation and Development Organization (SARDO), aims to promote the social and economic inclusion of people with disabilities into all aspects of life in Tanzania. As an adult with a physical disability, an arm amputated below the elbow, Archy grew up understanding how disability can create barriers to getting an education, getting a job or being accepted in the community. During the summer of 2019, Archy was invited to participate in the Professional Fellowship Program on Inclusive Disability Employment, which was supported by: U.S. Department of State, Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD); ICI-UMass Boston; and by Humanity &amp; Inclusion. This professional fellowship supported Archy during his five weeks of residencies in different States, where he learned about disability rights, small business development and employment inclusion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/solartricycle-web.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="827" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/solartricycle-web-827x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9565" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/solartricycle-web-827x1024.jpg 827w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/solartricycle-web-242x300.jpg 242w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/solartricycle-web-768x951.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/solartricycle-web-500x619.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/solartricycle-web.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 827px) 100vw, 827px" /></a></figure>



<p>Whirlwind met Archy while he was visiting Berkeley, California and learning about: local and international disability organizations; disability inclusive community support services; adaptive sports programs; as well as small shop wheelchair manufacturing. In the summer of 2019, Whirlwind provided Archy with a RoughRider wheelchair to take back to Tanzania with him, since he wanted to learn how to set up a RoughRider wheelchair workshop in his home village. After returning home and getting married, Archy saw the need to create a business, which makes and sells solar powered and handcycle tricycles, which would greatly help local persons who have limited mobility become more independent and be able to start a business or get an education.</p>



<p>So Archy developed a prototype of a solar powered electric tricycle, using locally available parts from friends. With a little technical assistance from Whirlwind, Archy successfully created in his workshop a solar tricycle prototype, using 26 inch bicycle wheels, including: an iron chassis, a 15W solar panel, a 24V motor and lithium batteries. Parts that were locally available from friends in Tanzania cost him $299, not including labor or the solar panel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DORKA-web.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="790" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DORKA-web-1024x790.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9566" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DORKA-web-1024x790.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DORKA-web-300x232.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DORKA-web-768x593.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DORKA-web-500x386.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DORKA-web.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>In addition, Archy has created a handcycle tricycle, which is less expensive, in order to meet the mobility needs of persons with disabilities who do not have much money. Local people have been watching as he constructed his prototypes of solar powered and handcycle tricycles and many people have said that they wanted to buy one. Archy has identified the parts that he wants to purchase from China in order to make larger quantities of these solar tricycles for sale and he wants to expand his workshop business in order to begin selling handcycle and solar powered tricycles and to be able to sell his tricycles in other cities. If you wish to financially or mechanically help Archy finish his prototypes and go to the next stage of of his business by making larger quantities of these tricycles for sale, please contact him:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">RoughRider Wheelchairs to Oglala Lakota Amputees</h2>



<p>During the last week of July 2021, Whirlwind sent a RoughRider wheelchair to Mike Black Elk, who is a single amputee and a client of the Oglala Sioux Tribal (OST) Vocational Rehabilitation Services on Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota. On August 2, another RoughRider wheelchair was sent to Kevin Poor Bear, who is a double amputee and also a client of the OST Vocational Rehabilitation Services.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jim-warner-web.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jim-warner-web-819x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-9564" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jim-warner-web-819x1024.jpeg 819w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jim-warner-web-240x300.jpeg 240w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jim-warner-web-768x960.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jim-warner-web-500x625.jpeg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jim-warner-web.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></a><figcaption><em>Jim Warne at the OST&nbsp;</em><br><em>Vocational Rehabilitation Office&nbsp;</em><br><em>on Pine Ridge Reservation</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jim Warne, photographed with one of the Roughrider wheelchairs that he helped Whirlwind donate to the OST Vocational Rehabilitation Office, also helped the University of South Dakota to establish the Oyate` Circle, a Tribal College Disability Center. The Oyate’ Circle is a resource, education, outreach and training effort that serves Native Americans with disabilities in South Dakota. Led by Oglala Lakota tribal member Jim Warne and named after the Lakota word for “the people,” the Oyate’ Circle conducts education and outreach campaigns about the needs of Native Americans with disabilities. It also offers resources and training for tribal communities and informs them about programs and opportunities available through the center and other agencies.</p>



<p>Both wheelchairs were sent free of charge to Mike and Kevin by Whirlwind due to a generous gift from the widow of Frank Barham, a wheelchair user who was accidentally killed on the highway by a semi-truck while conducting a RoughRider wheelchair fundraising campaign outside of Atlanta, Georgia. Upon receiving Adriana Barham’s donation, Whirlwind set up a Frank Barham Memorial Fund to subsidize RoughRider wheelchairs for Americans who were unable to purchase one for themselves or their family members. These two wheelchairs are the last of 25 RoughRider wheelchairs, which were subsidized by the Frank Barham Memorial Fund and distributed to low-income individuals in the United States from 2019 to 2021.</p>



<p>Whirlwind is hoping to receive additional funding to continue sending RoughRider wheelchairs to Native Americans who need a rugged outdoor wheelchair, which can easily travel over the difficult environments in which they live and can be easily repaired with locally available welding and bicycle parts. The RoughRider wheelchair has been distributed in over 60 countries across the world because of its ability to move easily through mud, grass, snow, uneven streets, and cobblestones without tipping over.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots" id="electric"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Next Electric RoughRider Wheelchair</strong></h2>



<p>Whirlwind and the Coalition for Independent Living created an electric RoughRider wheelchair in 2014 in the Republic of Georgia by using electric bicycle technology from China. Since 2014, the Government of Georgia has purchased 275 electric RoughRider wheelchairs and distributed them throughout Georgia. However, this electric bicycle technology was 10 years old and was not constructed with high-quality components, which required the Georgian Wheelchair Workshop to modify and improve this technology. Currently, their electric RoughRiders have been free of working problems for one year of use.</p>



<p>From this Georgian experience, Whirlwind now understands that in order to successfully use electric bicycle technology for electric wheelchairs in developing countries, we need to identify hub-motors and electronics, which will work reliably over several years without any breakdowns or modifications.</p>



<p>Whirlwind proceeded to identify a business in China, NIOION TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD, which had experience with power wheelchairs and power add-on technology and we asked if they would be willing to help us to adapt their electronics to a Roughrider wheelchair. The President of NIOION, Avery Liu, enthusiastically identified a hub motor, controller, joystick and lithium battery and Whirlwind purchased a RoughRider wheelchair from the CLASP warehouse in Shanghai for NIOION to use for their prototype development in their facilities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24inch-wheels-with-hub-motors.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24inch-wheels-with-hub-motors-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9563" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24inch-wheels-with-hub-motors-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24inch-wheels-with-hub-motors-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24inch-wheels-with-hub-motors-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24inch-wheels-with-hub-motors-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24inch-wheels-with-hub-motors.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Avery assembled the components onto his RoughRider wheelchair and shared a small video of the working prototype. These components are now being shipped to Ralf Hotchkiss and will be assembled onto a RoughRider wheelchair and tested for durability and mobility performance. After Ralf has determined that the hub motors and electronics work successfully and reliably over several months, Whirlwind will be shipping a 2nd set of hub motors and components to the ARSOBO RoughRider factory in Nogales, Mexico for them to prototype and possibly sell locally in the Mexican market. The ARSOBO manager said that they have received several inquiries from local individuals who want to purchase an electric wheelchair. Whirlwind will send a 3rd set of hub motors and components to the RoughRider factory in the Republic of Georgia for them to test locally and a 4th set of hub motors and components to the KIFAS RoughRider factory in Turkey. Hopefully, we will be successful with our electric RoughRider 2 prototype and Whirlwind can begin exploring how to expand the availability of a low-cost, foldable, lightweight, electric RoughRider wheelchair through the CLASP business network.</p>

<p>Nine months ago, your organization helped me by giving me a RoughRider wheelchair for a price I could afford on my low income. I live full time in a camper van out in nature and I wasn’t able to get around on the rough terrain that I live on with my walker or a standard wheelchair and I can’t go very far with my crutches. My life was very limited and although I could look at nature every day from my van, I could not easily explore it. Since I got my Whirlwind RoughRider wheelchair, I have learned to wheelchair “hike” with it. I have taken it on lots of trails and I’m getting really good at traversing difficult terrain.</p>



<p>Last week I was lucky to be able to visit the Acadia National Park in Maine. The scenery was breathtaking! And because I had my RoughRider wheelchair, I was able to go “hiking” and see the scenery up close! Here is a picture of me sitting next to Jordan Pond in my Whirlwind wheelchair! Your organization made this experience possible for me and I am immensely grateful! Thank you so much for the amazing work you do getting us disabled folks out into nature. I can never thank you enough for the amazing experiences I’ve had “hiking” in my chair over the last 9 months. You are all amazing! Keep up the good work!</p>



<p>With love and gratitude,<br>Sarah Meg</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kellogg Racial Equity Challenge 2030</h2>



<p>In 2020, the W.K. Kellogg Racial Equity Challenge 2030 announced that it was offering $90 million to help build and scale actionable ideas for transformative change in the systems and institutions that uphold racial inequities. Whirlwind was invited to join a consortium of 6 organizations, Arizona Sonora Border Project for Inclusion (ARSOBO), University of Arizona Sonoran Center for Excellence in Disabilities, Warrior Society Development, LLC, Oyate Circle, University of South Dakota, Center for Disabilities, Whirlwind Wheelchair International, Bio-mechatronics Group, Center for Extreme Bionics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Hanger Prosthetics &amp; Orthotics), which proposed a 5-year project.</p>



<p>The project would be carried out by Redefining American Indigenous Disability Inclusion Equity Now and Tomorrow (RAIDIENT), a reservation-based social enterprise focused on disabilities and employment inequities. RAIDIENT’s vision is to reduce Native American disability inequities by establishing four Native American social-enterprises that would address disability health technologies and services for over thirty Tribal Nations.</p>



<p>We proposed to train and hire Tribal members with disabilities to build for others the medical devices they use themselves. The RAIDIENT team includes disability advocates and Native Americans with disabilities who would use their cultural heritage and professional expertise to promote community development for Native American Tribes. RAIDIENT would “on-the-job” train Native Americans with Disabilities on Tribal Reservations to implement professional services including RoughRider wheelchair assembly, wheelchair repair and modification, customized prosthetic/orthotic fabrication, hearing aid distribution, diabetes management and amputation prevention programs.</p>



<p>Sadly, our consortium of 6 organizations was not successful and was not included in the final selection of 10 projects. However, ARSOBO is continuing to work with the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Reservation in Arizona in order to provide low cost hearing aids and RoughRider wheelchairs and Whirlwind has donated two RoughRider wheelchairs to Lakota amputees living on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dear Friends and Supporters,</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile-150x150.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-9559" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile-150x150.jpeg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bruce-profile-100x100.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>It is now December 2020, eight months since the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown. The sale and distribution of Whirlwind Wheelchairs is on hold. As the quarantine began in April, Whirlwind staff decided to take a furlough, while doing our best to answer requests for wheelchairs and technical assistance.</p>



<p>Because of the severe shortage of protective face masks early in the pandemic, Contra Costa County offered Whirlwind a large number of N95 masks to give out to persons with disabilities. Whirlwind had hoped to distribute the masks through the numerous local disability organizations. Unfortunately, most disability organizations had closed their doors, so we are still looking for ways to distribute these masks.</p>



<p>Starting in 2019, Whirlwind began providing low-cost, subsidized Roughrider wheelchairs to persons on low fixed incomes. This was made possible by a generous $25,000 grant from the Frank Barham family. We have provided subsidized wheelchairs to 15 individuals so far.</p>



<p>Ralf Hotchkiss, Whirlwind’s founder and member of our board, worked early this year at ARSOBO, the Roughrider Wheelchair factory in Nogales, Mexico. Dr. Burris Duncan and Kiko Trujillo of ARSOBO have expressed interest in manufacturing an electric Roughrider with assistance offered by the engineering department of the University of Arizona. Whirlwind is sending ARSOBO a new model electric Roughrider from the Coalition for Independent Living factory in Tbilisi, Georgia. ARSOBO will examine and test this chair in hopes of optimizing it for their manufacture and use in rural Mexico.</p>



<p>In our 2020 annual newsletter, we are including stories from Whirlwind riders around the world. The cover story features a disability organization whose members had tried to push wheelchair riders up the extremely steep pathways of an ancient pilgrimage in Galicia, northwest Spain. The goal of the pilgrimage is to honor the apostle St. James the Great in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Another story is revealed in a request for replacement parts by two Haitian Roughrider owners. Both received their chairs from Whirlwind 5 years ago after their catastrophic earthquake.</p>



<p>Whirlwind needs any amount of financial donations that you can provide to help us survive the COVID-19 quarantine lockdown. Even though our operational costs are low, Whirlwind’s income has been greatly reduced. No one knows if or when the economy will return to normal and many donors have changed their priorities in order to deal with the problems of COVID-19.</p>



<p>All contributions to keep Whirlwind alive and operating are greatly appreciated!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With gratitude,&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>In October 2015, we attempted to make the Pilgrimage of the <em>Camino de Santiago</em> to realize the dreams of a group of people, that due to their physical disabilities and without the helping of our volunteers, had never lived this experience.</p>



<p>This amazing experience, which was unimaginable for most disabled persons, has been the motive for planning another way. But, to do it we purchased 5 RoughRider wheelchairs from FUNDACION BERTHA O DE OSETE in Mexico.</p>



<p>After a long and arduous process of talking with customs and drug agency officials, we only had to talk to the Pope and the King, we were able to get the RoughRider wheelchairs out of the Spain customs. I think we got the certificate for being tired.</p>



<p>We completed a stage on the Camino de Santiago from Roncesvalles to Logroño, without speaking! We are always in contact with the local police, as that year the <em>Policía Foral de Navarra</em> were with us for almost the whole time.</p>



<p>Firstly, when the couple of policemen introduced themselves to us, they told us they could stay with us for only one day because they had other things to do, however it didn’t happen that way. The second day of walking toward Pamplona, we called the police to communicate that we were starting to walk and they told us that they would be waiting for us at a crossroads, which would lead to a road accessible to our group. But the police were not there, so we followed the signs and those signs led us to the ancient road, Camino de Santiago. It was an old mountain side path that became so narrow, that we couldn’t go back. We could only continue very carefully because on one side we had the wall of the mountain but on the other side we had nothing but moss on the path edge, and if we would step on the moss, we would slip. There was even a moment where our volunteers had to lift up each wheelchair with the person sitting in it. When we got to the end of the mountain path the police were waiting for us, surprised to see that we had passed through with the wheelchairs. From that day on they became our Guardians and I think they won´t forget us and we won´t forget that day either.</p>



<p>In October 2019, we did another stage of the <em>Camino de Santiago</em>, this time from Logroño to Burgos. Unfortunately, this year 2020, we won´t be able to do another stage due to Covid 19 and until the situation is calmer, we prefer to postpone until next year. I hope so. We have more people/partners interested in coming with us: either to travel or to enjoy the walks in the fields that we do every month. We also participate in the San Silvestre Vallecana; as well as a Marathon for people with intellectual disabilities; or in the walk for the integration of people with disabilities.</p>



<p>As you can see, we are making the most of the RoughRider wheelchairs and are proud to be able to bring out smiles and of course we always enjoy our people becoming part of our family.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b><a id="grandmother"></a>A Request from HCBH hospital in Haiti</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h2>



<p>Hello Whirlwind,</p>



<p>I am messaging from HCBH hospital in Haiti. We have 4 RoughRider wheelchair users who need some replacement parts. We need main wheel bearings for 4 wheelchairs, plus 3 new pairs of front wheels, the worst of which is coming apart. These parts are for very active guys (you can see them at work making a table) who have enjoyed their RoughRider wheelchairs for 4 years. They look after them so well but the physical material on the front wheels need replacing.&nbsp;&#8212; <em>Rob Dalton</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/haiti-hcbh.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/haiti-hcbh-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9581" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/haiti-hcbh-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/haiti-hcbh-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/haiti-hcbh-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/haiti-hcbh-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/haiti-hcbh-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/haiti-hcbh.jpg 2016w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p><em>Ralf Hotchkiss responded:</em></p>



<p>You need to research local hardware stores or motorcycle shops to identify if they have the following size bearing available to purchase: Bearing#6202 (15mm inside diameter &#8211; 35mm outside diameter &#8211; 11mm thick). This is a common bearing available worldwide, which is why it was selected for use in the hub bearings and front wheel bearings on the RoughRider wheelchair. This #6202 bearing usually has a long life but it will only work for 1 to 2 years in the rough conditions of Haiti near the sea. I am speaking with a local bearing manufacturer in Oakland, California about making an improved version with a longer life, possibly up to 5 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In your photographs, there is a lot of rust on the frame and forks and to maintain the strength of the metal, they need to be sanded down and repainted to protect the metal from corrosive salt water and other chemicals in the Haiti dirt/mud. Use steel wool or sandpaper to sand down the rust on all of the metal and after sanding it down, use a spray can of rust reformer paint to protect the metal. If you cannot find rust reformer paint, use the common red primer, which is available almost everywhere.</p>



<p>The conditions of the roads and dirt paths in Haiti are extreme for wearing out the rubber on the front wheels. We suggest new front Zimbabwe wheels for each person plus a backup replacement pair. Therefore, we will send you 16 Zimbabwe wheels with axles/bearings. We are hoping that you will be able to find replacement tires for the back wheels in Haiti? They are available at bicycle shops, which carry 24-inch tires.</p>



<p>Wow! What amazing advice and what an incredible offer of the Zimbabwe wheels! Harold (a very active user I see every day) just had his front left wheel snap off yesterday and is very upset. The RoughRider wheelchair is literally the best physical possession he has and his lifeline to the world. This is amazing news. I will hunt for the wheel bearings; those measurements will prove invaluable! We also have sandpaper and red oxide rust paint to apply when changing them. SO grateful for your help!</p>



<p>Regarding the back wheels, one RoughRider user here (Fritz, the carpenter in the photos) has replaced his back tires with mountain bike style tires and they work great.</p>



<p><em>(Whirlwind sent 16 Zimbabwe wheels, new spokes, 32 bearings #6202, hand-packed at Whirlwind with 80% grease, instead of the normal 40% grease, for a longer life.)</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Whirlwind Wheelchair: What Can Come Next?</h2>



<p>We stay committed to working with members of the Whirlwind Network to appraise and improve the Whirlwind Roughrider. We are striving toward independent mobility, further and further away from the beaten track. We need the best of chairs for the worst of conditions.</p>



<p>The pandemic has made it harder to exchange new ideas with our network &#8211; travel is out of the question. But some of Whirlwind’s best collaborators are taking advantage of the quarantine and trying out inventions for which they had no time before. Among these are some who have invented critical aspects of Whirlwind’s chairs for over 40 years! We just hope that all in our network, along with our families, come out on the other side healthy and strong.</p>



<p>Our latest Roughrider is designed for use both indoors and outdoors. It is exceptionally strong, but no heavier than a standard wheelchair. This chair is buildable and repairable with tools and materials that are available throughout most of the world. But while the Whirlwind is more mobile than most wheelchairs, there are places where it is too slow, too hard to push, or where it simply cannot go. We do have potential solutions for some of these problems, but can we make these solutions practical?</p>



<p><strong>WASTED ENERGY</strong></p>



<p>A lot of the rider’s energy is wasted trying to push a wheelchair over paths that are tilted for drainage. The weight on the front wheels pulls them down the slope, the front wheels turn to the side and the chair veers off the trail. To force the front wheels to turn back up the slope the rider must drag one hand on its hand-rim. This is like riding with the brakes on. More than half of the rider’s energy is often taken just to keep the front of the chair from being pulled down into the gutter.</p>



<p>A chair will roll in a straight line along-side slopes if it has very little weight on the front wheels. Some riders reduce the weight on their front wheels by moving their rear wheels to a position further forward on the chair. They ride their chairs very easily, regardless of side slopes. They also tip over backwards easily, especially when they climb hills.</p>



<p>The rear wheels can be safely moved forward, thus nearly eliminating downhill turning, if a flexible wheelie bar is installed on the back of the chair. We hope that we can design a wheelie bar that functions very well, yet still is cheap, light and simple.</p>



<p>A wheelie bar unfortunately blocks the way when the chair and its rider are being pulled backwards upstairs. When the chair rolls away from the stairs, the wheelie bar must be re-deployed to keep the chair from tipping backwards. This re-deployment must be automatic, yet purely mechanical.</p>



<p><strong>POWER BOOST</strong></p>



<p>Many wheelchair riders can push easily over flat floors, but they lack the strength and endurance to go very far outdoors. They don’t want the cost and weight that come with full power wheelchairs; they just need a little push.</p>



<p>The tip of a well-designed wheelie bar could serve as an excellent mounting point for a single motorized wheel. The rider could travel quickly while still pushing as hard as was comfortable on their hand-rims. They would still get the exercise they need. The harder they could push on their hand-rims, the farther they could go and the lighter and cheaper their battery could be.</p>



<p>We are happiest when we have the input of the experts we know. They are wheelchair riders, welders, bicycle builders, engineers, artists and business people, women and men, very young and very old. We need the wisdom of anyone from anywhere who has the interest to observe and create; the more diverse the network the better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best of chair for the worst of conditions!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Designing 21st Century Vehicles For Persons With Disabilities</h2>



<p>The Merlin Prize for accessible, autonomous, electric vehicles (A2EV) is a crowd-sourced design competition to generate innovative and inclusive transportation solutions for people with physical, sensory, and/or cognitive disabilities. Automotive industry experts predict that electric vehicles (EVs) will surpass the number of gas-powered vehicles on the road in the coming decades, and virtually all autonomous vehicles are electric. The goal of this challenge is to make autonomous, electric vehicles accessible for all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/merlin-ev-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="483" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/merlin-ev-1024x483.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9582" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/merlin-ev-1024x483.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/merlin-ev-300x141.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/merlin-ev-768x362.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/merlin-ev-1536x724.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/merlin-ev-2048x966.jpg 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/merlin-ev-500x236.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Whirlwind Board members Ralf Hotchkiss and Bruce Curtis were contacted by the Merlin Mobility Foundation and invited to speak with Lawrence Williams, the founder of Merlin Mobility and President of the Merlin Mobility Foundation. Mr. Williams explained his interest and reasons for creating the Merlin Prize Challenge and invited both of us to participate as judges. The 16 judges were asked to identify their 1st, 2nd and 3rd place choices from the engineering design submissions of individuals, as well as, from organizations. After lengthy discussion among all of the judges and based on the total scores received by individual judges, the three Merlin Prize Challenge winners were identified. However, everyone was in agreement that no one had submitted a design proposal for an accessible electric automobile, which was ready for commercial production.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Request from Fort Larned National Historic Site</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/fort-larned-ranger.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/fort-larned-ranger-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9583" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/fort-larned-ranger-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/fort-larned-ranger-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/fort-larned-ranger-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/fort-larned-ranger-500x667.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/02/fort-larned-ranger.jpg 1512w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>When Fort Larned National Historic Site built a new parking lot in 2013, getting to the Visitor Center became a much longer walk over historic ground. In other words, visitors cannot access the historic buildings or the Visitor Center in a vehicle. We have visitors daily who don’t mind the quarter mile walk. But there are plenty of visitors who are not able to walk for various health reasons. Many are elderly, yet still yearning to learn about our history.</p>



<p>The Roughrider wheelchair has been used by appreciative visitors for about 6 years. It solves the problem of visitors who need a wheelchair, which sometimes happens daily. The visitors and staff are dependent on having the wheelchair. It is still in good condition except the back and seat upholstery are worn out. Do you have replacement parts so we can get it fixed up this winter?</p>



<p><em>George Elmore</em><br>Chief Ranger<br>Fort Larned NHS</p>



<p><em>Whirlwind responded:</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are sending you a 2-inch seat tube extender that is already attached to your new seat fabric, which you will screw into the existing holes on the 14-inch seat tubes. You just need to unscrew the screws holding the seat fabric, take out the long thin metal form inside the seat fabric seam edge. Then insert the long thin metal form inside the seat fabric seam edge of the new seat fabric and screw the seat fabric into the frame with the screws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the new back rest fabric, you will need to pull the push handles off of the back of the chair before you pull the backrest fabric over the backrest tubes. Please use boiling hot water in two, 1/2-gallon plastic containers, and put both push handles while still attached to the back rest tubes into the hot water for about one minute. Then you can pull off the plastic push handles. Pull the back fabric over the backrest tubes and reattach the push handles with crazy glue.</p>

<h2><b><a id="letter"></a>Whirlwind Goes Back To Our Roots</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2793" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BruceCurtis-150x150.jpg" alt="Bruce Curtis" width="150" height="150" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BruceCurtis-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BruceCurtis-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BruceCurtis-100x100.jpg 100w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BruceCurtis.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />With the holiday season approaching, we would like to thank all of you whose contributions have helped give hope and support to so many people around the world this past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many of you are aware, Whirlwind has undergone many changes in 2019, including the retirement of the Executive Director, Marc Krizack, and the addition of its original Founder and Chief Engineer, Ralf Hotchkiss to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Board of Directors. These changes have resulted in a new direction and challenge for the work Whirlwind will be undertaking in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ralf’s original vision included helping to develop small metal-shops that are capable of manufacturing the Roughrider wheelchair, using hand tool technology and standard bicycle parts, while also providing local wheelchair repair, modifications and employment for persons with disabilities to manufacture, repair and modify wheelchairs.</span></p>
<h3><b>Recent Wheelchair Market Trends</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the early 2000s, almost all of the major wheelchair makers in the world are currently making their wheelchairs in large factories in China. Many of the small wheelchair making businesses in developing countries, which also employed wheelchair users as workers, went out of business in the last 15 years because they were unable to sell their wheelchairs for a commercial price after religious and humanitarian charities donated thousands of free wheelchairs into their countries. That immense flood of chairs bankrupted local wheelchair businesses, and also eliminated the local wheelchair repair services, as the economics of fixing those factory chairs no longer made sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s world, some wheelchair users in developing countries are receiving higher quality wheelchairs through free international donations but they cannot find any wheelchair repair services to sustain the active life of their wheelchair and after 1-3 years are desperately searching for a replacement wheelchair.</span></p>
<h3><b>A New Chapter</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 15 years of successful work manufacturing the RoughRider in a modern Chinese factory, in order to provide large quantities of wheelchairs for international distribution, Whirlwind has witnessed the benefits of quality production jigs and quality control inspection in order to produce thousands of reliable and safe wheelchair. Therefore, we are now revisiting the original vision of promoting and sustaining small-scale wheelchair businesses with new and valuable perspectives about how to upgrade and improve their production jigs and the importance of&nbsp; training staff to conduct quality control inspections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whirlwind wants to offer the small RoughRider manufacturers our newest design of the RoughRider wheelchair, including new seat and back upholstery and the handbrake design. In order to increase the active life of all RoughRider wheelchairs, Whirlwind wants to update their understanding of the importance of using sealed bearings, aluminum hubs and rims, as well as how and where to purchase quality parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning in 2020, Whirlwind will begin to provide technical assistance to the surviving small RoughRider manufacturers/businesses in developing countries and help them to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update earlier models of the Roughrider wheelchair to the latest design</span></em></li>
<li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve the existing welding jigs</span></em></li>
<li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source raw materials and repair parts at the best quality &amp; lowest price</span></em></li>
<li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train staff to evaluate each wheelchair user according to WHO wheelchair provision guidelines</span></em></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Whirlwind Needs Your Support!</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whirlwind creates and supports </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheelchair Ecosystems</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We make small-scale wheelchair businesses possible, with a wheelchair product that provides daily mobility to people who might not have any other opportunity to leave their home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would like to invite you to join us by making a very generous contribution this holiday season to help us implement our goals of <strong>helping wheelchair users to stay active</strong> and working in their communities around the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your donation also helps Whirlwind to <strong>promote and support small businesses</strong>, which employ wheelchair users, while also <strong>providing local wheelchair repair services</strong> and modifications.</span></p>
<h3><b>Purchasing RoughRiders Helps Us Too!</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way you can help us would be to consider <a href="/product/roughrider/">purchasing a RoughRider wheelchair</a> for an elderly parent or a relative or even a friend who could benefit from having a way to go outside and enjoy the world. </span><b><i>The profits from each Roughrider wheelchair sold on our website directly funds Whirlwind’s operating budget, they are as crucial to our survival as traditional donations!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of what we are trying to accomplish will take time, and with your support, you are helping Whirlwind to change the lives of so many people all over the world. I hope you will join us to help expand our reach and influence into the new year.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With gratitude,&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b><a id="recipients"></a>Stories From RoughRider Recipients</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Rodriguez, who lives on Pico Island in the Azores Islands of Portugal recently purchased a Roughrider wheelchair to continue her daily walks with her 75-year-old husband who has Parkinson’s. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do need the wheelchair quite urgently …my husband still walks a bit but without the wheelchair there is no way we can go out every day as we try to …and it would be a shame.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deanna Welka in memory of her father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My father is in a hospice and we have been taking him outside, along a gravel path beside a creek, in a regular wheelchair …needless to say we broke the wheelchair. This led me to think that a donation of a gravel and grass friendly wheelchair to the hospice in my father’s memory, might be a useful gift for other families who wish to take their loved ones farther afield to enjoy nature.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alejandro D’Armas Menéndez, a double amputee in Havana, Cuba:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since receiving my RoughRider my life has changed radically. In the same moment that it was taken out of the box and was assembled, I felt an attraction very similar to love at first sight, really. My heart was beating strongly, my hands were sweating. I could smell the sweet fruit of an unequaled [gift], and… experienced a nervousness like I [have] never known before.&#8221;</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;From Caitlyn Meyers in Iceland:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve now had my RoughRider for a couple years and it continues to give me access to parts of my life that I thought I would never get back… I rounded a corner of the steep path along Þingvellir Iceland,</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">on this most recent trip, guiding my chair around obstacles, and suddenly saw an entire waterfall that I hadn’t known existed. On our honeymoon, I’d had to stop at the top of that path because I knew my legs wouldn’t carry me. I feel so grateful for what my RoughRider has given me and how much more I can accomplish now.</span></i></p>

<h2><b><a id="grandmother"></a>A RoughRider for an Indigenous Grandmother</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, Whirlwind received a request to provide a RoughRider wheelchair for Grandmother Agnes Baker Pilgrim (95yrs) in support of her work as Chief Spokesperson for the</span><a href="http://www.grandmotherscouncil.org/who-we-are"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-5720 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/agnespilgrim.jpg" alt="" width="852" height="852" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/agnespilgrim.jpg 852w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/agnespilgrim-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/agnespilgrim-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/agnespilgrim-768x768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/agnespilgrim-500x500.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/agnespilgrim-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grandmother Agnes had two common hospital transport wheelchairs, which did not move easily over the grass or gravel and were very difficult to use in rural or dirt environments. Her daughter Nadine (69yrs) would push her wheelchair whenever Agnes was traveling internationally to attend important events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whirlwind received a donation from</span><a href="https://plenty.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty International</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the cost of the wheelchair, which would make it much easier for Nadine to push Grandmother Agnes over the rough terrain they encountered during their international travels, and with a frame that is strong enough to survive rough handling by airplanes and taxis and which can be easily and cheaply repaired by using local welding shops or standard bicycle parts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whirlwind&#8217;s Chairperson, Bruce Curtis, and Levan Talakhadze, a wheelchair technician certified by the World Health Organization to evaluate wheelchair users, drove from Berkeley, California to the home of Grandmother Agnes in Grants Pass, Oregon in October 2019 to deliver the Roughrider wheelchair. Levan adjusted the length of the footrests and the height of the armrest for her to be comfortable and attached a push handle extender, which would make it easier for her daughter Nadine to push the wheelchair with one hand. Levan also provided some simple explanations for how to use the wheelchair going down the ramp or across her front lawn. Agnes said that it was the very first time she had traveled over her front lawn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, we recently received notice that Grandmother Agnes had died on November 27, 2019, just one month after receiving her new wheelchair. Whirlwind has sent an email expressing our sadness at her passing and encouraging her daughter Nadine, to donate Grandmother Agnes&#8217;s Roughrider wheelchair to another indigenous grandmother or someone else in her tribe.</span></p>

<h2><b><a id="morocco"></a>One World Project in Morocco</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During September and October 2019, Whirlwind’s Bruce Curtis and Salam Hassan provided technical assistance and supervision in Morocco, as disability consultants to the International Research And Exchange Board (IREX), in order to implement a 12-month project in 4 Provinces of Morocco, Beni Mellel, Draa’a, Marrakesh and Tetouan, with IREX’s Moroccan disability partners, the disability NGO </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">White Dove</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the social enterprise </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peace Wheels</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. IREX’s Morocco project will educate local wheelchair users, DPOs, government officials and media journalists about the need for buying different models of wheelchairs and for the provision of wheelchairs according to WHO Basic guidelines.</span></p>

She also received one of the active wheelchairs, purchased by IREX&#8217;s One World Project through USAID&#8217;s CLASP Program, as did most of the wheelchair users who participated in the Camp.</span></p>

<h2><b><a id="barham"></a>Frank Barham Memorial Fund</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, Whirlwind <a href="/the-frank-barham-memorial-fund/">received a generous donation</a> of $25,000 from the widow of Frank Barham, to provide subsidized Roughrider wheelchairs to individuals who could not afford to pay the full price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, in 2019, Whirlwind has shipped subsidized Roughriders to wheelchair users in New Mexico, California, Massachusetts, Colorado, Missouri and Montana.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffrey Wasilowski, a recent double amputee, had only a broken wheelchair.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Sharp, receives a small social security check, and loves camping outdoors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaRae Gallegos, living on Social Security, was in a car accident five years ago and her wheelchair does not work well in the Montana environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whirlwind will continue providing subsidized Roughriders as we get requests from individuals who cannot afford the full price. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please consider <a href="/donate/">making a donation</a> in support of Whirlwind providing subsidized Roughriders for Americans who are living on a fixed income and cannot afford to purchase a Roughrider wheelchair.</span></p>
