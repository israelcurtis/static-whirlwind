										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">Whirlwind was contacted  last summer by Joshua Van Winkle about a wheelchair that could handle the rugged terrain of the Amazon jungle. He was planning an ancestral trip for three generations of families, including an elder gentleman that needed a wheelchair that was sturdy and reliable.  We recently received this thank you letter that touched our hearts. We were glad to have been able to help him out to make his extraordinary journey a success!</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"><strong>LETTER WE RECEIVED FROM JOSHUA VAN WINKLE:</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Dear Whirlwind,</em></p>
<div dir="auto">
<div>
<p><em>Last August my friend Ankur Wate (who had trained and worked extensively with a man named Don Cesareo for many years in the jungle) and I planned a group trip down to Secoya territory (and their ancestral homelands near the Ecuador/Peruvian border called Lagarto Cocha) with him.</em></p>
<p><em>Unfortunately Don’s older wheelchair was in poor condition and unable to traverse rough Amazonian terrain for such a trip.</em></p>
<p><em>So Abkur suggested we look around for a wheelchair that would could do such a task. And we found your website online.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div dir="auto">
<div>
<p><em>As all of us that were planning to go on this trip work normal jobs and were by no means financially wealthy, so we wrote to Marc personally asking if he was able to discount the price of a normal Roughrider model so we could afford to get it for Don.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div dir="auto">
<div>
<p><em>Marc was super generous and discounted it for a fair price. So myself and another friend split the cost and brought it down to Ecuador for him as a gift. </em><em>I personally am a custodian with the local school district at the moment, but I, and a group of close friends have a very strong connection with the Secoya people.</em></p>
<p><em>On this particular trip last August, we spent about 2.5 weeks down there to bring together 3 generations of Secoya families together for a special trip to Lagarto Cocha, their ancestral homelands, for time together and traditional ceremonies that the elders have been upholding and practicing since a young age.</em></p>
<p><em>It was a very special trip made possible by Marc and everyone at Whirlwind for making such an awesome wheelchair. </em><em>He had an amazing time as did we all.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for all of your help and generosity.</em></p>
<p><em>Best regards,</em></p>
<p><em>Joshua Van Winkle</em></p>
<p>We are always happy to hear when the RoughRider has made someone’s ability to travel off the beaten path possible. We look forward to continuing to help more people reach their dreams!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Read about the RoughRider rough-terrain Wheelchair that gets people off the pavement and out into the roads less traveled. Our riders write us from national parks, beaches and even the jungles of the Philippines!</p>
<p>When our wheelchairs allow someone to gain a greater sense of independence and freedom, we know that we need to keep working and pushing forward to design wheelchairs giving greater freedom and independence through mobility for all!</p>
<p><strong>Eric Logan – <em>WINNER of the ROUGHRIDER BEST PHOTO CONTEST!<br />
</em></strong>Eric’s photo was taken at Surigao del Norte in the Philippines. He won $50 USD OR free push handle extenders for every photo that we used in 2017 and 2018!</p>
<p><em>Here is what Eric had to say about his RoughRider:</em></p>
<p>Dear RoughRider,</p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="EN">I&#8217;m Eric Logan and I love your product! My photo was taken in Surigao del Norte, Philippine on the island of Mindanao.  That&#8217;s where I have used it for everything from a marathon to daily exercise or just getting around where there is no sidewalk.  I like challenging myself, so I look for the biggest hill, or mountain and try to go up and down it several times.  I have used this chair on the ocean bottom (really), where my wife family lives in Surigao. It bumps up against the China Sea, and at low tide, in some places, you can literally walk on the sea floor. You guys have a great chair and really half the world that needs a chair could really use one.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span lang="EN">Thanks a lot for creating it!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Whirlwind we love hearing from people whose lives have been changed by the <a href="/product/roughrider/">RoughRider</a> wheelchairs we are able to provide for them. When our rugged-terrain wheelchairs allow someone to gain a greater sense of independence and freedom, we know that we need to keep working and pushing forward to <a href="/donate/">help those in need</a>.</p>
<p>This is just how we felt when we heard from Alejandro, a Cuban gentleman who shared his story of what life was like before and after receiving his <a href="/product/roughrider/">RoughRider</a>. Prior to an accident that resulted in the amputation of both his legs, Alejandro had lived a very active life style. He struggled with many different types of wheelchairs over the years, unable to accomplish simple, everyday tasks and was dependent on other people to help him with his life. He also emphasized the time, energy and cost that was wasted due to the limitations of other wheelchairs he had owned.  He wrote to tell of his experience after receiving his Roughrider wheelchair, where he expresses how his life has been dramatically changed for the better.</p>
<p><strong>LETTER WE RECEIVED FROM ALEJANDRO:</strong></p>
<p><em>Hola amigos,</em></p>
<p><em>My name is Alejandro D&#8217;Armas Menéndez. I live in Havana, Cuba. I&#8217;m 54 years old. I have a degree in Plastic Arts and Radio Amateur that I received 12 years ago. Both of my legs were amputated, one below and the other above the knee as a result of an automobile accident.  I never really found out, I was unaware of the existence of this company that manufactures wheelchairs before I met you. You came to me by chance.</em></p>
<p><em>About 2 months ago they told me in my health area to pick up a wheelchair that had arrived as a donation, with no more details than that. Prior to the accident, my life was the same as that of an ordinary Cuban. I did physical exercises, I danced, I swam, I walked long distances and did other outdoor activities, I climbed mountains, etc. and others. After the accident, my life became very difficult and complicated, I was dependent on other people for almost everything. In the 25 years that I have been using a wheelchair, my hands have passed over more than 11 different kinds of wheelchairs. </em></p>
<p><em>The limitations to these other wheelchairs are gigantic and horrible,. I suffered a lot because I could not do what I liked the most. It was a lot of work spent many jobs to sit in them from any position, I spent a lot of energy to work or move. To climb or descend simple slopes or sidewalks, I had to be helped by someone. It took up more of my time and resources to repair the chair and make it into something I could use then time that could have been spent on doing things that were more useful.</em></p>
<p><em>The most common issues I experienced were the punctures of the tires. I was very limited because of the adverse conditions and situations that occurred almost daily. I had suffered and suffered so much that I hated the wheelchair I had been using with my whole being. </em></p>
<p><em>One day I went to Havana&#8217;s Malecón and I thought to get rid of the chair I would throw it into the sea!&#8230;For a second I felt like I’d lost my he had lost my mind. I only held back when my conscience awoke and, I recovered. My reason and I did not find my legs.</em></p>
<p><em>Since receiving my RoughRider my life has changed radically. In the same moment that it was taken out of the box and was assembled, I felt an attraction very similar to love at first sight, really. My heart was beating strongly, my hands were sweating. I could smell the sweet the fruit of an unequaled and never before experienced a nervousness like I never known have before. </em></p>
<p><em>Believe me, I do not exaggerate when I share this.</em></p>
<p><em>Now I can move everywhere, including the province of Mayabeque, covering a little more than 60-70 kilometers. With the confidence that I will not suffer from the bitter breakdowns with my chair. Now I can keep my hands cleaner.  My friends are also very happy every time they see me sitting in my Roughrider and with the joy on my face. Now I can go up and down the sidewalks without falling, now I can move regardless of the weather, or the quality of the streets or roads. A few days ago on a slope downhill and in free fall I reached around 10 km / h speed. Never before had I dreamed I could do this much less accomplish.</em></p>
<p><em>I find the Roughrider to be very safe, despite any sudden turns and crazy maneuvers that I oblige it to perform, it maintains it’s balance and stability; its wide rear tires, grip the asphalt very well in an incredible way. It is very light, with less than half the forces used to move in the previous ones. The Roughrider, breaks the inertia; occupies only the necessary space, neither more nor less, without reducing comfort; it even allows me to go through narrow places and tight spaces.</em></p>
<p><em>With my new Roughrider wheelchair I feel the safety, balance and comfort it offers me all at the same time.</em></p>
<p><em>Gracios my amigos,</em></p>
<p><em>Alejandro</em></p>
<p>Hearing from Alejandro and how his life has been changed by receiving a RoughRider wheelchair from Whirlwind is the reason we do the work we do. We look forward to continuing the work we do each day to help more people reach their dream of the freedom and independence they deserve!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, I was still struggling with pain and reduced strength in my legs from when a car hit me while I was crossing the road six years previously. I was also planning my June wedding to the man I love and who was searching for answers to my medical questions alongside me. I was determined to walk down the aisle in heels, even though my legs would often give out unexpectedly and leave me stranded on a curb when I would go out with friends. I know now that my fear of mobility aides and of the word “disability” was actively harming me and making my condition worse. After our wedding, my new husband Jon and I honeymooned in Iceland. We have always loved traveling together, and this trip was one of the best we’ve ever experienced. There were time, though, where my limited mobility kept us from exploring as freely as we wanted to. Hiking was not possible for me, and even exploring out from the jeep we had rented was difficult. We took some beautiful pictures in our wedding clothes out in the Icelandic lava fields, but there was still so much we didn’t get to do.</p>
<p>Four years later (just this past month), my husband and I, along with his family, went back to Iceland. I’ve now had my Rough Rider for a couple years and it continues to give me access to parts of my life that I thought I would never get back when I finally decided to get a chair. We went back to some of those same beautiful sights, like Þingvellir and Geysir, and I was able to be a part of the journey in more ways than I had been able to on our honeymoon. I rounded a corner of the steep path along Þingvellir on this most recent trip, guiding my chair around obstacles, and suddenly saw an entire waterfall that I hadn’t known existed. On our honeymoon, I’d had to stop at the top of that path because I knew my legs wouldn’t carry me. I feel so grateful for what my Rough Rider has given me and how much more I can accomplish now.</p>

<p>We recently received this post from Craig Pierson on Facebook “This Summer a group of us went to Masaka, Uganda to build a playground at Jireh Children&#8217;s Center. While there we met Fatuma. As you can see her wheelchair was in pretty rough shape. When we came back to the States I started a quest to find her a wheelchair that would better suit her needs with the rough terrain of Uganda. Here is her old wheelchair, and here is her new wheel chair. The smile tells it all.. — at Jireh Childern&#8217;s Center, Masake, Uganda.” Craig used <a href="http://216.172.184.37/~ab85381/programs/">Whirlwind&#8217;s Traveler&#8217;s program</a> to bring Fatuma a RoughRider.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing Craig we are glad she is enjoying her RoughRider!</p>
